              One and a half years later, I find myself in a similar state.
              Today, I&#39;m pinching myself still over the events of&nbsp;the
              past several weeks since I last wrote to you. I tried bouldering
              for the first time, and then rollerblading for the first time. I

            <br />
            Well, plenty of odds. All&nbsp;these&nbsp;new, exciting things have
            something in common: Each&nbsp;one made me deeply question whether
            or not I was &quot;cut out for it&quot;. Whether or not I was 100%
            ready before committing<i>.</i><br />
            <br />
            I haven&#39;t gone on a run in a very long time. My upper arm
            strength is, uh... let&#39;s say <i>shy...</i>&nbsp;so my first
            bouldering experience&nbsp;only consisted of 4&nbsp;beginner-level
            climbs that left my hands red and sore. For 7 years I&#39;ve
            harboured long-held beliefs when it came to the prospect of a
            new&nbsp;relationship:
            <em>What if it ends badly? Or in hurt?&nbsp;</em><br />
            <br />
            I even nearly&nbsp;<em>didn&#39;t</em>&nbsp;join this trip
            to&nbsp;Singapore, insisting to my friends that I&#39;m hesitant
            about taking time off work,&nbsp;before finally giving in.<br />
            <br />
            So then, why am I here?&nbsp;On a flight, arms still sore,
            butterflies in my belly, and the happiest I&#39;ve ever been?<span
              style="

              >&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              The only possible reason, of course, dear Friend, is that I have
              gone rogue, and slightly delirious.</span
            >&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            <em>&quot;Are you crazy???&quot;&nbsp;</em>my inner gremlin
            says.&nbsp;<em>You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!&nbsp;</em

            These changes set sirens&nbsp;off in my mind, paired&nbsp;with a
            joyful&nbsp;elevator&nbsp;tune. It&#39;s very offbeat in there.<br />
            <br />
            Perhaps the gremlin is right. I certainly would not consider myself,
            right now, as someone who&nbsp;<em>could&nbsp;</em>run a 10K, or
            climb a freaking wall, or fall in love.<br />
            <br />
            But perhaps that is the point.

              An interesting story&nbsp;on why I joined that 10K: I have always
              wanted to be good at running. For years I would have a few months
              of consistently going on runs, and then I&#39;d travel or the
              weather would get cold or I&#39;d grow tired of it or for whatever
              reason, I&#39;d eventually stop. And months later, I slowly
              get&nbsp;back to it again. And this would happen yearly.<br />
              <br />
              The reason I&#39;ve always wanted to be
              a&nbsp;<em>decent&nbsp;</em>runner is because, deep down, I&#39;ve
              always wanted to run a marathon. But of course, it has always
              lived in a vague, distant future&mdash;or rather, alternate
              universe&nbsp;where I am&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em> fit&nbsp;and have
              built a&nbsp;<em>flawless&nbsp;</em>habit of running everyday at
              6AM and can run miles without losing my breath.<br />
              <br />
              As I was saying this to my boyfriend when we were on a hike
              together,&nbsp;he suggested, &quot;You kind of have to sign up for
              one first, right? Like sign up now, and that way you&#39;ve at
              least made the commitment to&nbsp;a registration fee, and
              then&nbsp;you&#39;re motivated&nbsp;to reach a&nbsp;goal.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Casually he said that, and off&nbsp;he went down the mountain
              path. While&nbsp;I stopped in my
              tracks.&nbsp;<em>Huh!&nbsp;</em>Why hadn&#39;t I thought of it
              that way?<br />
              <br />
              Because in my mind, I was preoccupied with
              making&nbsp;<em>myself&nbsp;</em>qualified (read:
              perfect)&nbsp;before doing the big scary commitment.&nbsp;I&#39;m
              still someone who needs to train up to a seamless 5K, let alone a
              10. But, my plan has been flipped on its head. Instead of willing
              and waiting myself to embody a runner
              and&nbsp;then<em>&nbsp;</em>commit &quot;when I&#39;m ready&quot;,
              I did the big thing first, and now have to follow through.<br />
              <br />
              We will rarely feel ready or qualified for the things we want
              most. But&nbsp;there <em>is</em> an alternative&mdash;a bolder
              route: To say yes first. To do the big scary commitment first, and
              through progress and practice, work <em>towards</em> being
              qualified, rather than waiting around assessing our own ability
              and worth before taking any action.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              To not feel cut out for it, and do it anyway. To let the delirium
              motivate us to something beyond what we&#39;d imagine ourselves to
              become.</span
            ><br />
            <br />

              share with you, aren&#39;t too far off from what I said in
              <a href="40-on-final-days-and-wonder.html">my last letter</a>: Our
              time ends sooner or later. We&#39;re not on this earth forever,
              and it shall still orbit and bloom and turn and babies will still
              laugh and autumns will still be beautiful and waterfalls will
              still roar and cities will still be built, before&nbsp;<u>and</u
              ><em>&nbsp;</em>after us.<br />
              <br />
              And this fact is not to scare us, or to point us to nihilistic
              apathy. But to recognise that my every minute, my working limbs,
              this beating heart&mdash;though it carries with it flaws and
              grief&mdash;are all a package of undeserved gifts, not meant for
              me to keep for myself.<br />
              <br />
              And when you recognise that fact, that all your life is but a
              product of grace, is when change starts to happen. It&#39;s like
              an anchor gets hooked to the base of my heart, and my whole being
              now harbours a new gravity.<br />
              <br />
              A gravity where I couldn&#39;t afford to wait. I couldn&#39;t
              afford to think twice, three times, four times over whether or not
              I&#39;m worth it, or cut out for it, or can do or say the right
              and perfect thing. Regardless of the answer, I need to get
              moving.<br />
              <br />
              So in the 72 hours of my birthday weekend (and yep, I
              extended&nbsp;past the usual 24-hours this year because I can), I
              sat and ate and laughed and hugged the wonderful rays of sun I get
              to call my friends. I run and swim and climb and feel the silliest
              and most vulnerable I&#39;ve ever felt, but also the most alive. I
              grip onto the hand of someone who told me they chose me, and I
              make the conscious choice&nbsp;to believe them.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              In the words of Cheryl Strayed, &quot;Don&#39;t be strategic or
              coy. Be brave. Be authentic. We&#39;re all going to die, Johnny.
              Hit the iron bell like it&#39;s dinnertime.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Don&#39;t hesitate. Give in. The odds are always going to be
              against us, friends. Better tango with it while we can.</span
