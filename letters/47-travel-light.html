              <br />
              Do you know how a rocket ship gets launched into outer space?
              Okay, maybe the answer to this&nbsp;is<i
                style="font-style: normal"
                >&nbsp;literal</i
              >&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal">rocket science...&nbsp;</em
              >but I was watching a video yesterday by
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Dbe-5Kv_Y&list=TLPQMjQxMDIwMjPoWYIms3T_tw&index=2&ab_channel=EzinneZara"

                >Ezinne Zara</a
              >, and she mentioned what has to happen in order for a rocket to
              ascend.<br />
              <br />
              But before I tell you, I might redirect us to something far
              older&nbsp;than space travel. It is a story in the Bible about a
              woman named Hannah.<br />
              <br />
              The Bible tells us that though Hannah was a wife, she
              was&nbsp;barren and couldn&#39;t conceive a child. It&#39;s
              difficult to deny as you read her chapter, just how much
              this&nbsp;grieved her deeply. She would cry, lose her appetite, go
              into temples&nbsp;and cry some more, inconsolably.<br />
              <br />
              Until one day, Hannah went into a sanctuary, and finally uttered a
              brokenhearted prayer.<br />
              <br />
              She said,
              <em style="font-style: normal"
                >&quot;God, if&nbsp;you will take a look at my pain,&nbsp;answer
                my prayer and give me a son, then I&rsquo;ll give him back
                completely&mdash;unreservedly&mdash;to you.&quot;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              The final part of her words is what&nbsp;I couldn&#39;t
              comprehend:&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal"
                >If you give me what I want, I&#39;ll give it back to
                you.&nbsp;</em
              >What do you mean you&#39;re giving back something you were asking
              for? Something you even rightfully deserve?<br />
              <br />
              And here, I shall bring us back to space travel. The way a rocket
              ship flies into space is that the more weight it can shed away,
              the higher it can go into the atmosphere. The rocket needs to
              carry or hold onto&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal"

              <br />
              For many of us, we are under the guise that the older you become,
              the more things you have to carry or hold onto. This is true
              materially&mdash;you now have a career, a job, a home, car and
              health insurance, mortgage, savings, maybe a family or a child.
              Our grip tightens around our treasures, and we guard it with
              everything we&#39;ve got.<br />
              <br />
              Where we may sometimes be misguided is by thinking we need to have
              all these Things in order for life to be fulfilling.<br />
              <br />

              Traveling light may look different for different people. It might
              be sacrificing some things in order to make more space for
              you;&nbsp;it might be letting go of the need to please
              people&#39;s opinions; it might be hitting pause on your endless
              pursuit of The Thing and simply giving into the rest provided in
              the present season, regardless of where&nbsp;it takes you.<br />
              <br />
              It can look like many different things, because that is faith. It
              is assurance in the things we hope for, though we don&#39;t see
              it. Though we can&#39;t have it in the palm of our hands right
              now. But that means we must learn to travel light.<br />
              <br />
              So that we can continue onward. Because the joy promised in the
              journey is real and there for us, too. So much so, that we may
              even look up towards that atmosphere, and be so in awe of what
              awaits us, that we pay no attention to the things that needed to
              fall away.</span
