              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I was running late.<br />
              <br />
              I admit, I am chronically tardy, and constantly underestimate the
              time it takes me to get from point A to point B.<br />
              <br />
              But I swear,&nbsp;I can explain this time.<br />
              <br />
              Minutes before my doctor&#39;s&nbsp;appointment
              (aforementioned&nbsp;point B), I did pace around my tram
              stop&nbsp;and thought,&nbsp;&quot;Okay, if I catch this next one,
              I&#39;ll just be&nbsp;<em>three&nbsp;</em>minutes late past the
              appointment time. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s fine!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              The tram was eight minutes away. What I like to do when this
              happens &ndash; being someone who ironically&nbsp;is always late,
              but hates waiting still in one place &ndash; is I walk my way to
              the&nbsp;<em>next&nbsp;</em>tram stop, only a few hundred metres
              down the road, just to pass the time.<br />
              <br />
              So on I walked, past a souvlaki place and&nbsp;a basketball court
              and a kids&#39; playground and a grooming salon, until I reached
              the second stop and waited for the tram to arrive. I could see the
              previous stop from where I was standing, so could also see when
              the tram did eventually appear.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              <em>Perfect</em>, I thought,&nbsp;<em
                >only a minute &#39;til it&nbsp;moves my way.</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Only, it didn&#39;t. The tram&nbsp;halted, in fact, at that
              previous stop&mdash;the one I&#39;d&nbsp;just left.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              <em>What&#39;s going on?&nbsp;</em>It was further up the road, and
              I could hardly see the driver nor any passenger. The tram stayed
              where it was for five long, agonising minutes. Soon, I spotted
              passengers alighting the tram, making their way, on foot, towards
              my direction.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              <em>Oh no,&nbsp;</em>I thought.&nbsp;<em
                >This tram literally broke down.</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              I panicked. I only had about&nbsp;10 minutes to make it to a
              clinic that was 4 kilometres away. I could either&nbsp;shell out
              for a $20 Uber ride &ndash; and even if the Uber came with a wait
              time, I would&#39;ve been late either way. I couldn&#39;t see nor
              hear what was going on in that tram given I&#39;d&nbsp;<em
                >walked this far up the road away from where it
                halted.&nbsp;</em
              >I had no other way of getting to the clinic, no officers to ask,
              no station in sight.<br />
              <br />
              And that&#39;s when I saw it. A lime-green Lime bike perched near
              the entrance to a housing complex.<br />
              <br />
              I mean,&nbsp;<em>I could...?&nbsp;</em><br />
              <br />
              I looked around. Oh God, this would be embarrassing. But also, how
              <em>fun&nbsp;</em>would that be??<br />
              <br />
              I approached the bike. <em>Should I??&nbsp;</em>I
              <em>can</em> ride one. I haven&#39;t in at least a whole year.
              What if a car honks at me? What if something happens? What if I
              miss a turn?<br />
              <br />
              Do I have a choice? I looked back at the tram, still unmoved. It
              seems I do not.<br />
              <br />
              In a movie, I&#39;d imagine this act would be accompanied by a
              rock-and-roll soundtrack. This isn&#39;t a movie, so I&#39;m going
              to need <em>you</em>, Friend,&nbsp;to imagine it as I narrate this
              story, to make it seem cooler than it is.<br />
              <br />
              Still in panic mode, I frantically scanned the QR code, figuring
              out how a Lime bike actually works, while pulling up my Google
              Maps at the same time, and putting on a dusty helmet and peeking
              into the front basket that, I&#39;m pretty sure, have been well
              used by the locals as a public ashtray.<br />
              <br />
              Nice.<br />
              <br />
              I slung my bag over my shoulder.
              <em>Welp, here goes nothing.&nbsp;</em>With no time to lose,
              saddled over the seat only to realise this was my first time
              ever&nbsp;on an e-bike.<br />
              <br />
              I&nbsp;wobbled awkwardly off the curb, onto the road, made my
              first pedal only to almost topple onto a parked car.<br />
              <br />
              <i>Damn it, Jo. Get it together.</i><br />
              <br />
              I tried again, and once I got it&mdash;the&nbsp;acceleration and
              weight that goes with a motorised bike&mdash;I finally
              pedalled.<br />
              <br />
              Cobwebs peeled off the tyres as I propelled forward for the first
              time. (I could literally hear a crunching sound, like I had
              cracked this vehicle awake.)<br />
              <br />
              And I pedalled left, and right, and left, and right, until I got
              the hang of it, and it was like I could do it forever.<br />
              <br />
              When I tell you, Friend, I&nbsp;<em>sailed</em>. This god-awful
              neon green long-forgotten bike with cigarettes in her basket and
              I.<br />
              <br />
              I&nbsp;lunged forward and sailed up and down the hilly Malvern
              Road, peering at passing houses and barren trees and swerving
              smoothly past construction sites, c<span

              >.<br />
              <br />
              It felt like I could do anything.&nbsp;Frosty wind and sunlight
              both pressed against my face and cheeks, and I smiled. I might as
              well have been in the open sea.<br />
              <br />
              I felt so free, so childlike. Also so crazy, exhilarated, and so
              out of my mind.<br />
              <br />
              Yet like the cobwebs,&nbsp;my crusted fears fell off that bike.<br />
              <br />
              <em>Imagine not doing this?&nbsp;</em>I thought.<em
                >&nbsp;What&#39;s stopping me? What would have?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Minutes later, I sat at the waiting room patting down my messy
              hair, slightly out of breath, still smiling.<br />
              <br />
              Have you ever thought about what&#39;s stopping us, Dear
              Friend?<br />
              <br />
              What&#39;s stopping you?</span
