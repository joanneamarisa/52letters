              <br />
              Remember how I wrote to you about
              <a href="hello-home-starting-anew-1.html"
                >dreams of flying elsewhere</a
              >&nbsp;last week? Well, when my head isn&#39;t so up in the clouds
              &mdash; on the train ride to work, for instance &mdash; I watch
              the passing suburbs in the morning and actually feel quite
              lucky.<br />
              <br />
              At 22, being able to say that I love my job feels like a luxury.
              There are many reasons, but one of them is I get to &nbsp;pocket
              small nuggets of wisdom as I walk out of our Wednesday
              meetings.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              There are these bite-sized phrases my manager Suzanne likes to
              say, and I don&#39;t suspect she means to be profound, but I find
              myself repeating and pondering on every bit of advice. I plant
              them as seeds in my little mind garden and while digging the soil,
              I&#39;m surprised by what I find. May I share with you some of
              them?</span

                and then somewhere mid-sentence your brain just... lost the
                plot? Some days, our team would hold a meeting where Peter, our
                daily manager &amp; office expert in analytics, would run us
                through a graph. I&#39;m a sucker for charts, but frankly (and
                Peter knows this) there are moments where I (and the rest of the
                team) struggle to&nbsp;keep up.<br />
                <br />
                It&#39;s like those lines in a TV show where the tech guy
                explains something&nbsp;and the protagonist goes,
                &quot;...&nbsp;<em>In English?</em>&quot; We find humour in
                these moments as Peter, bless his soul, can get carried away for
                a minute or two&nbsp;spewing terms that to him
                make<em>&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;</em>sense.<br />

              So nowadays, I, too, am a big believer in &#39;beta-testing&#39;
              everything. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m qualified... but why not
              just reach out? Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m cut out for
              leadership... but I won&#39;t know until I try. Don&#39;t know if
              I could write a newsletter... but I&#39;ll send one out and see
              what happens. (And well, here we are!)<br />
              <br />
              A 90% benchmark makes life so much easier to live. Not waiting for
              my work (or myself) to be 100% perfect makes the path clearer and
              less obstructed by self-imposed hurdles. Trading perfectionism for
              honesty is about letting the world see you a little undone, maybe
              even nervous, but showing up anyway. Allow life to be an iterative
              work in progress, leaving a trail of &quot;final&quot;,
              &quot;final-1&quot;, &quot;final-2&quot; drafts which are yes,
              about 90% there, but may lead us closer and closer to something
              we&#39;ll love.

              If you&#39;re someone who thinks they can cram 4 tasks into the
              last 15 minutes of a workday, we might be very much alike.
              We&#39;re... What&#39;s a nicer word than over-achieving?
              Proactive to a fault?<br />
              <br />
              This one came from a meeting where we were discussing our yearly
              planner. Looking at it, I suggested instinctively: &quot;<em
                >Oh. Well would you like me to do&nbsp;A and B and a little bit
                of C so we can get that campaign&nbsp;off the ground?&quot;</em
              >&nbsp;Something along those lines.<br />
              <br />
              To which Suzanne looked at me and&nbsp;said,
              <i
                >&quot;Well, that would be great but&nbsp;we&#39;re going to
                need another you,&quot;&nbsp;</i
              >she smiled.&nbsp;<em
                >&quot;You&#39;re&nbsp;<u>one</u>&nbsp;person.&quot;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s a silly thing to&nbsp;<em>need&nbsp;</em>to be reminded
              of; that I am one person&nbsp;with only 2 hands, 2 eyes, 24 hours
              each day.&nbsp;Yet almost absent-mindedly I was ready to set
              myself the test of shouldering what would be a 2-to-3-person
              task.<br />
              <br />
              Overestimating our own capacity&nbsp;can be a sign of equal parts
              people-pleasing and habitually putting ourselves secondary to the
              &#39;task&#39;.
              <em
                >This is probably going to burn me out, but I can handle
                it!&nbsp;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Those in our 20s are so prone to letting work (or even
              &#39;passions&#39;)&nbsp;overtake the better of us, such as our
              health, our social lives, our rest.&nbsp;Even working overtime
              feels like second nature. And naturally, we&#39;re at the age of
              proving our own self-sufficiency.&nbsp;The less attractive truth,
              however,&nbsp;is we&nbsp;are just&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>person.
              Some might even say,
              <a
                href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/opinion/self-sufficiency-generosity.html"
                >self-sufficiency is overrated</a
              >.<br />
              <br />
              May I suggest: Asking for help &mdash; and learning
              to&nbsp;<em>receive&nbsp;</em>it? May I suggest honesty, to others
              and ourselves, about what&#39;s within our means and what probably
              isn&#39;t? Or may I suggest, at the very least &mdash; and I&#39;m
              speaking this over myself, too &mdash; avoiding burnout not with a
              spa trip or a scented candle, but with not setting ourselves up
              voluntarily in situations that may lead to it in the first
              place?</span
