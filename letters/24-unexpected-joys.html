              >My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Oh, what a month. How is your October? I hope it&#39;s been
              fun.<br />
              <br />
              Last week, I spent much of my&nbsp;time in my room;&nbsp;an
              ominous thunderstorm has been passing over Melbourne recently. But
              after&nbsp;several&nbsp;days of being cooped up at home, I
              suddenly woke up last Friday to a bright, sunny morning.
              Pleasantly surprised, in 15 minutes I was already in my sneakers
              and out the door.<br />
              <br />
              I hadn&#39;t visited Fawkner Park in a long time &ndash; it&#39;s
              my favourite, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen me
              <a href="autumn-and-impermanence.html">gush about it</a
              >&nbsp;before. However, when I finally reached it, I realised that
              in one of their fields &mdash; on which I sometimes see people
              playing cricket or football &mdash; there was a construction
              site.<br />
              <br />
              A fact about me you don&#39;t need: I <em>hate</em> construction
              sites. I hate seeing them wherever they randomly appear. The cold,
              uninviting steel barriers that would one day obstruct my sidewalk,
              paired with those orange cones or little flag buntings.
              <em>Pedestrians go this way!&nbsp;</em>Go where, exactly?<br />
              <br />

              field into a massive dirt patch. The dirt stretches the width and

              <br />

                    >&quot;For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is
                    sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between
                    soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our
                    innermost thoughts and desires.<br />
                    <br />
                    Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is
                    naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom
                    we are accountable.<br />
                    <br />
                    So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered
                    heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we
                    believe. This High Priest of ours understands our
                    weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet
                    he did not sin.&nbsp;So let us come boldly to the throne of
                    our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we
                    will find grace to help us when we need it most.&quot;</em
