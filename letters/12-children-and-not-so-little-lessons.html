              <br />
              It must&#39;ve been&nbsp;when I found myself sitting on
              my&nbsp;bedroom floor, playing a game of Monopoly with a
              7-year-old boy, that I finally thought:&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              <em>&quot;What.... am I doing....&quot;</em><br />
              <br />
              I swear months ago, I would&#39;ve logged off work&nbsp;and simply
              minded my own business &mdash; maybe even go for a&nbsp;shop or
              meet a friend for a cocktail. Fast forward to June and I am
              hunched over a 4-year-old&#39;s&nbsp;fingernails, putting&nbsp;on
              glitter&nbsp;nail polish and struggling for dear life&nbsp;to get
              them on her tiny, tiny fingertips, in a colour that, she says,
              would &quot;go with her outfit tomorrow.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Oh, I&#39;m forgetting context: They are my sister&#39;s children.
              Seven, four, and one.&nbsp;My sister, a hands-on stay-at-home
              mother who swears against hiring babysitters, shares a house with
              us. Thus, for the past 6 weeks I&#39;ve been introduced to a
              delightful, chaotic&nbsp;brand new experience:&nbsp;Living with
              children.<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;d love to tell you about it, if you&#39;d let me.</span
            ><br />
            <br />
            <span
              style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400"
              >First, the clear marking of territory. There is a&nbsp;part of
              the house that my parents&nbsp;inhabit; marked&nbsp;by bookshelves
              and memorabilia and sensible office supplies &mdash; so
              <em>adult&nbsp;</em>and <em>rectangular</em>. And
              then,&nbsp;there&#39;s the&nbsp;rest of the house, identifiable by
              half-eaten cereal bowls, drawing books, Barbie dolls, and Play
              Doh...&nbsp;<em>So, so much Play Doh...</em>&nbsp;I&#39;m sure you
              can guess who runs&nbsp;this part.<br />
              <br />
              Second, is the somehow&nbsp;omnipresence of little children.
              They&#39;re somehow just...&nbsp;<i>everywhere. All the time.</i
              >&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Third, is the noise. It&#39;s always when I&#39;m sitting at our
              breakfast table at 7 AM, peacefully admiring my mother&#39;s
              backyard &mdash; sipping my tea, reading my book&nbsp;when all of
              a sudden,&nbsp;it&#39;s 7:15.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;<i>Auntie!!!!&quot;</i></span

              <br />
              And yet. Even though it&#39;s true that the&nbsp;house is rarely
              silent, that a mess is always imminent&nbsp;and my personal space
              is loosening as a concept,&nbsp;I strangely adore co-existing with

              >My nephew &mdash; the 7-year-old sitting across the Monopoly
              board from me &mdash; is a bit of a trivia wiz. (Or a know-it-all
              in the making, we haven&rsquo;t quite decided yet.)<br />
              <br />
              When we&rsquo;re together, he asks me things like:
              <em
                >What is a cruise ship? What do monks do? Did you know what
                happened to the 16th US President?</em
              >&nbsp;(Between you and me, I&#39;m just wiping&nbsp;my brow each
              time I happen to know the answer.)<br />
              <br />
              The kid thinks in facts. For example, he knows a plane had crashed
              into the Twin Towers in 2001. But <em>because</em> he&#39;s a
              child, he doesn&#39;t know about the abstract concepts that come
              with the facts &mdash; like what
              actually&nbsp;caused<em>&nbsp;</em>the plane to crash and why,
              because that would mean a concept of &#39;there is bad in the
              world but not always&#39;. Even more mind-twisting was when the
              boy recited to me the shootings of Abraham Lincoln and JFK, with
              an unnerving amount of detail. &quot;His mom called him John,
              Auntie,&quot; he told me, &quot;but other people called him
              Kennedy.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;m a bit shaken by the fact that Google has served up these
              stories to this sweet 7-year-old boy so easily. I don&#39;t know
              how his brain is making sense of it. The boy is far smarter than I
              am, so I don&#39;t waste my time trying to appear adult or
              all-knowing. So I figure it&#39;s just about helping him
              understand.</span

              >So whenever possible, I invite him to dip his toes into thinking
              critically with me. Disclaimer: He doesn&#39;t always want to join
              me. But when he does, I take the chance to start a bigger-picture
              dialogue that sounds a bit like:<br />
              <br />
              &quot;<em
                >That&#39;s not okay, right? When people hurt people? What
                happens when we hurt other people?&quot;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Again, I&#39;m just winging it, but if I&#39;m lucky, he&#39;d
              respond with a &quot;Well, that&#39;s sad&quot; or &quot;Yeah
              it&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Raising&nbsp;big questions to a child teaches me that we bridge
              when we simplify. In a similar vein, raising dialogues with people
              who hold vastly different ideologies or understanding from me is
              not about whose fact gets the last word, but about who&#39;s
              willing to try to understand.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              I try to project 5-10 years into the future and hope that the boy
              raises the same questions when his classmate comes to
              <em>him</em> with facts. Or at least draw his own conclusions
              about the good and bad of the world and what to make of it.
              (Isn&#39;t that what
              we&#39;re&nbsp;all<em>&nbsp;</em>constantly<em>&nbsp;</em>doing
              anyway?)<br />

                acceptable. I notice they are less concerned with
                &#39;order&#39;.<br />
                <br />

                <br />
                But they are firm when it comes to respect. I learn that this

                receive something?&rdquo; Reminding kids to say
                <em>sorry, please</em>, and <em>thank you </em>is just basic
                programming of social cues. Having to model the actions,

              seen checking my phone when I&rsquo;m spending time with them.
              That&#39;s a standard, set through modelled behaviour.<br />

                children, and our&nbsp;personal space to them is already
                non-existent.&nbsp;Still, my hope is it trains the muscle in
                their thought pattern&nbsp;to realise they do have a choice.
                They always have a choice.<br />
                <br />
                Especially today, I am trying to&nbsp;advocate (in micro
                scales&nbsp;like these) about&nbsp;not having to physically
                interact with anyone in any way you&#39;re not comfortable with.
                This escalates anywhere from behaviour-modelling for my
                sister&#39;s children&nbsp;to the phone call I have with my
                friend when she tells me about the guy she&nbsp;recently started
                dating.<br />
                <br />
                At the end of each night, the kids do knock on my door. We hug
                good night, wave good bye, and as they slowly&nbsp;close my
                door, I only ponder that out of all the choices in the
                world,&nbsp;I&#39;m lucky to be one of theirs.</span
