              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Someone rang my intercom at around 9 in the morning. I put down
              the dishes I was washing, and said hi to him over the
              speaker,&nbsp;&quot;Yes I&#39;ll let you up!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said nicely. His name is James, and
              he&nbsp;was the locksmith assigned to help me fix the balcony lock
              in my apartment that day.<br />
              <br />
              A late-middle-aged man wearing&nbsp;a dark blue cap and a grey
              button shirt with <em>l</em
              ><em>ock &amp; lock locksmith</em>&nbsp;stitched above his pocket.
              Minutes later, I was opening the door.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Hello!&quot; he bellowed, before&nbsp;I let him in.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Good morning!&quot; I answered. &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Good, good&ndash; You know I used to have a cousin, who
              lived right on this street!&quot; he said, eyes
              widened.&nbsp;&quot;In a house, right here!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Oh no way!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Yes! That was back in, uh, the 1960s or so. Now they&#39;re
              all buildings that just go up and up.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              That&#39;s how I learned James was a man of stories. I was his
              first customer of the day, and I ushered him to the lock on my
              balcony door, that wouldn&#39;t budge ever since I moved in.<br />
              <br />
              And you might be thinking,&nbsp;<em
                >Jo... what thief would go in through a balcony on the
                20th&nbsp;floor?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              But... you never know.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Yeah you&#39;re my first one today!&quot; he
              explained.&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m heading to The Alfred after this, I
              got a heart transplant.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              <em>Oh!&nbsp;</em>I said. The Alfred Hospital is only a 5-minute
              drive away.&nbsp;<em
                >Damn it, what do you ask to someone who&#39;s had a heart
                transplant??</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              &quot;Um..... are you alright?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Yeah I&#39;m good! I&#39;m good. It was 13 years ago,&quot;
              he said. And for some reason I sighed, relieved.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;G<span
                style="
                  color: rgb(85, 85, 85);

                "
                >ot an appointment later today, so you know, thought I&#39;d
                start earlier.&quot;&nbsp;<em>Yeah fair enough</em>, I say. I
                didn&#39;t ask about the transplant itself as I didn&#39;t want
                to probe.</span
              ><br />
              <br />
              I thought of going back to my dishes, or my work, but I didn&#39;t
              want to be rude. So I just lingered in the kitchen, awkwardly, the
              way you wait on&nbsp;a technician or&nbsp;plumber doing their
              work. All the while James is pulling out screws from the balcony
              door, shaking his head at it saying, &quot;These apartments
              &mdash; terrible design!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;I know,&quot; I said. But truthfully&nbsp;I&#39;m none the
              wiser about&nbsp;door lock design.<br />
              <br />
              I engaged in conversation again. &quot;So just a checkup at the
              Alfred?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              <em>Yes!&nbsp;</em>He explains it&#39;s his start-of year
              appointment, and how he goes every 6 months. The many tests,
              including blood tests, &quot;and an exercise test which I&#39;m
              not looking forward to,&quot; he said.<br />
              <br />
              We laughed. &quot;Because they tell you to do lots of
              things?&quot; I asked?<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Oh, you know before this I used to love running!&quot; James
              replied. &quot;I loved it. Fit as ever, I was! But I think this
              person,&quot; and he pointed to his heart, &quot;this person
              doesn&#39;t like it as much! So since then it&#39;s like my body
              would just go&nbsp;<em>No, no way.&quot;</em><br />
              <br />
              When he said it like this I couldn&#39;t imagine. Having a piece
              of someone else inside you for life? I imagine what bonds that
              must bring &ndash; for a heart to change masters.<br />
              <br />
              James went on about his work and I was still leaning against my
              kitchen countertop. He told me about the issue of why the door was
              jammed, went down to his van and up again to grab extra tools,
              complained about the property owners some more. He told me about
              the &quot;French Spiderman&quot;, a man who&#39;s been climbing
              all these monuments and buildings without harnesses, without
              ropes, and has been arrested so many times.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Yeah look him up on YouTube after this!&quot; he said.
              &quot;And you can lock the door, &#39;cause he&#39;s still out
              there.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              At the end, he showed me how to close it, and&nbsp;it was
              fixed.&nbsp;I felt a tinge of curiosity wondering what got James
              into locksmithing, but it was the end of our time, so&nbsp;I led
              him on the way out.<br />
              <br />
              I felt it wasn&#39;t the end of the conversation, though, so I
              asked him the same thing I asked
              <a href="22-wealthy-and-healthy.html">Nikola the Uber driver</a>,
              whom I once wrote&nbsp;to you about.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Well lastly, actually!&quot; I said&nbsp;as he opened the
              door, &quot;what advice would you give&nbsp;for young
              people?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              I&nbsp;figured the best case scenario was I learn something, and
              the worst case was he would leave thinking I was strange. (Which I
              can live with.)<br />
              <br />
              James raised his eyebrows, seeming taken aback. &quot;Uh, you mean
              for like locks and stuff?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;No, just life in general!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Oh! Um!&quot; and he looked to the sun, through the balcony
              door that he was fixing.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;You know, <strong>enjoy life,&quot;&nbsp;</strong>he
              said.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Enjoy life, laugh... you know, even I&#39;m &mdash; I&#39;m
              singing when I&#39;m shopping! You know what I mean? And people
              look at me and go,
              <i>what&#39;s this crazy man- I&#39;m not going near him,&nbsp;</i
              >but&ndash; you know??&nbsp;<em>Enjoy</em> life.&nbsp;Look at life
              and love it.&nbsp;Some people, they&#39;re a hermit, and they stay
              at home... It&#39;s great to stay at home! But,&nbsp;make sure
              you&nbsp;<em>enjoy&nbsp;</em>things. Enjoy what you do. Like for
              me, it&#39;s music. I <em>love</em> music.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;And, uh,&nbsp;<strong>be a positive person.&nbsp;</strong
              >Stay positive.

              ><br />
              <br />
              He continued, &quot;I&#39;m caring for a lady who&#39;s in a
              wheelchair &ndash; she&#39;s my sister-in-law &mdash; and, uh,
              she&#39;s not a happy person,&quot; and&nbsp;this time in his
              voice there was sadness. James tells me about her failed
              marriages, her difficult attitude, even about one time in a
              doctor&#39;s waiting room where she was shouting to another family
              because of the colour of their skin.<br />

                ways. And often in a relationship, you gotta just &ndash; you
                gotta bite the bullet.&nbsp;You know? You need to go,&nbsp;<em

                <br />

              <br />
              But he was still smiling and laughing as he left. So we wished
              each other a good day, and I thanked him and closed the door,
              thinking all the while about the strength of a person&#39;s
              heart.</span
