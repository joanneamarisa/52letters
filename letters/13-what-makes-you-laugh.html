              >​My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I found it interesting, that in the
              <a href="https://forms.gle/LFDawZkfmLZwCFKE8"
                >anonymous readership survey</a
              >
              I sent to you for&nbsp;<em>Letters from Jo</em>, a topic
              that&nbsp;80% of you wanted to hear more of, was love.
              Relationships &mdash;&nbsp;from the platonic, familial, to
              romance&nbsp;&mdash; the breadth of which wouldn&#39;t fit in a
              single letter.<br />
              <br />
              I don&#39;t know if being single makes me
              <em>least</em> qualified, or <em>most</em> qualified to write
              about it, but I thought I&#39;d start with at least one piece of
              advice I know to be true: Find someone who makes you laugh.<br />
              <br />
              It applies to first dates, new friendship circles, meeting
              co-workers in a new workplace, scanning for a cousin you can get
              along with at the family gathering...&nbsp;Every time someone asks
              me about dating dealbreakers,&nbsp;I always mention, &quot;Sense
              of humour is top priority.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Ironically, I take the ability to not take oneself too seriously,
              very seriously. It&#39;s not about finding someone who&#39;s a
              jokester, really, but I think sharing a laugh signals effortless
              compatibility. When we laugh, we are in a state of openness. We
              only laugh when we feel comfortable, and light. In a world of
              facades, it&#39;s the unspoken permission to&nbsp;finally
              let&nbsp;your guard down. And
              <a href="out-of-hiding.html"
                >you deserve&nbsp;a life you can live with your guard down</a
              >.<br />
              <br />
              When interacting with someone new, try to observe what they laugh
              about. (But also <em>try&nbsp;</em>to do this
              without&nbsp;crossing into psycho-analysing... I know, I know,
              just... <em>try</em>.)<br />
              <br />
              What people find funny is actually very telling, both about who
              they are and about your potential alikeness. For example, a few
              years ago I went out with someone who would craft jokes
              <em>all </em>the time. At one point, he laughed about a
              person&#39;s disability, and this was one of the first laughs we
              didn&#39;t share. (I didn&#39;t like him much after that. We
              stopped dating, but as&nbsp;the universe would have it,&nbsp;he is
              now a stand-up comedian.)</span

              >A different example: My co-workers and I laugh at
              ourselves&nbsp;many times, about&nbsp;mundane things like phrasing
              a sentence awkwardly, misreading an email,&nbsp;or being nitpicky
              when it comes to feedback. At first when I was starting
              out,&nbsp;facing these mistakes made me nervous. Now, I&#39;ve
              joined them in the plains of:<em
                >&nbsp;Oh Jo,
                <a href="if-it-s-90-there.html"
                  >you&#39;re just one person!</a
                ></em
              >&nbsp;I can attest this work culture bears fruit &mdash; we form
              a trusting camaraderie, and are less&nbsp;stressed with ourselves
              during high-pressure situations.<br />
              <br />
              I personally love starting big presentations with a: &quot;Phew!
              I&#39;m nervous!&quot; Just to see everyone smile or laugh. Again,
              a practice in <a href="out-of-hiding.html">being seen</a>. After
              doing so, I can proceed while breathing&nbsp;a little
              more&nbsp;easily. Sometimes I can tell that breaking the
              ice&nbsp;catches people off guard, but it makes life less
              charade-like.&nbsp;</span

              <br />
              Dad had this &quot;gotcha!&quot; sense of humour. He was a big man
              and&nbsp;most of my friends who didn&#39;t know him thought he was
              intimidating. This was odd to me, knowing the man as&nbsp;a warm,
              generous&nbsp;jester&nbsp;with plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Out
              of everyone in the presence of his joke, though, he was always the
              one most entertained, laughing the longest at something he came up
              with himself. Maybe that&#39;s a Dad thing.</span
