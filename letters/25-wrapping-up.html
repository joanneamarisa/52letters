                Victoria Gardens dog park.</span
              ><br style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85)" />
              <br />
              This is where I would normally sit on Sunday mornings. But today,
              all of the spots&nbsp;were occupied.<br />
              <br />
              Not fully, though. And I was determined to sit somewhere soaked in
              sun, on a perfectly sunny day like this. So I gripped my coffee a
              little tighter, and mustered up the courage to say to a stranger,
              &quot;<em>Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?&quot;</em><br />
              <br />
              <em>No, not at all!&nbsp;</em>the young woman replied. So
              that&#39;s how I found myself sat next to her at 8:45, as she
              plays fetch with her Dachshund-Jack Russell mix, Albi.<br />
              <br />
              They have left now. Albi barks a lot when he doesn&#39;t get his
              ball, so when fetch time was over, he was unrelenting. The woman
              calmly decided they&#39;ll go for a walk instead.<br />
              <br />
              <em>&quot;Well, enjoy!&quot;&nbsp;</em>she said to me. &quot;<em
                >Are you journaling? Is that what you&#39;re doing? Oh &ndash;
                such a nice day for it!&quot;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              I don&#39;t know if every stranger sitting on a bench would be as
              welcoming. I don&#39;t know if other parts of the world would even
              have nice parks and nice strangers and barky dogs who want their
              ball back.<br />
              <br />
              So I savour this.<br />
              <br />
              The way I
              <a href="my-week-of-savouring.html">savour everything</a> to a
              sickeningly romantic state nowadays. I
              <a href="23-the-finiteness-of-it-all.html">take the train</a> and
              attempt to mentally capture everything. I treat mundaneness with
              indulgence. I&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>snuggle in on rainy
              days&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>take 2-hour walks when the
              skies are blue. I chew slowly and try to be a better listener and
              not feel so guilty for spending an hour doing nothing but reading
              a book.<br />
              <br />
              Everything is so finite and fleeting. I mean, it&#39;s almost
              Christmas. If we blink, we might miss it.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              October felt riotous, so I&#39;m very relieved we&#39;ve come up
              for air. While the end-of-year stress at work hasn&#39;t really
              subsided, but I take my romanticised train ride home every night
              and think, &quot;Today was enough.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              November offers a graceful reminder to finally let the year go.
              Lessons about wrapping up and letting go are really lessons about
              acceptance of what is left, and trusting in what&#39;s ahead. When
              the Christmas tunes start to play and the tinsel begins appearing
              in supermarkets or window stalls, we are reminded that it&#39;s
              time to wrap the year up.<br />

                >at wrapping things up.</span
              >&nbsp;I know because I&#39;ve spent one too many evenings working
              overtime, or too many nights staying up late doing tasks I swore
              I&#39;d do that day. I&#39;m also bad at considering a piece
              &mdash; be it in writing or art &mdash; as &quot;finished&quot;. I
              always want to edit and perfect to the point of oblivion
              everything I put out into the world.<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s unsustainable and exhausting. And that&#39;s why I gladly
              succumb to the ringing bells of Christmas time. When baubled pine
              trees appear, it&#39;s as if they say,&nbsp;<em
                >Ready or not, let&#39;s wrap the year up.</em
              ><em>&nbsp;</em>Do what you have to, but let go of what was.
              Everything you&#39;ve done has been enough. Everything you
              haven&#39;t done is forgiven.<br />
              <br />
              Because you are still here, and because there is a new year
              waiting for all of us. So does it even matter how perfect we all
              become in the end? Is not being in the present already worth the
              celebration?<br />
              <br />
              The dogs are waddling home now. I should probably leave too.<br />
              <br />
              Even after I say that, I&#39;m still fiddling with my pen,
              thinking whether I have anything more to say.<br />
              <br />
              I don&#39;t, though. Not for today.<br />
              <br />
              I hope you have a nice November, friend. Be kind to yourself,
              ok?<br />
