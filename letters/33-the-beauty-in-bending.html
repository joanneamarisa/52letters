              >I was sitting on the second level of a double-decker bus
              yesterday, driving towards the city after spending the day with a
              friend. I was reading the last pages of my book, when I decided to
              look up and out the window. We were riding along the bends of the
              Yarra River, the water glinting, and the city&#39;s silhouettes
              framing my view in the distance.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              The sun sank low, and it reached my face and hands, all awash in
              its warm glow. I squinted, to see the rowers making their way
              home. And I felt only peace, wishing the bus would go a little
              more slowly.</span

            If you have caught up with me at any moment in the past 6 months,
            you might be familiar with&nbsp;<a
              href="23-the-finiteness-of-it-all.html"
              >my flight risk</a
            >. Basically, up until mid-January, I was convinced it was time for
            me to leave and fly home for good.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I&#39;ll probably move soon,&quot; I said to friends and
            family, with only a teaspoon of conviction each time.<br />
            <br />
            The plan was March. It&#39;s March now, and there are dinner
            ingredients in my kitchen, and fresh laundry on the drying rack. It
            doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m going anywhere.<br />
            <br />
            In January, I landed a new job that I didn&#39;t expect to get. So
            after throwing in the towel, I&#39;ve had to awkwardly pick it back
            up, and re-enter the phase of:&nbsp;<em
              >Okay God... what now?&nbsp;</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            <em>I thought we had a plan! </em>I debate.&nbsp;<em
              >I mapped it all out and it was going to be easy.</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            <em><u>Whose</u>&nbsp;</em><em>plan?&nbsp;</em>He asks.<br />
            <br />
            And that kind of shut me up for a good few weeks.<br />

              For example, this became apparent when I was helping my family
              plan their trip to Melbourne later in April. At one point, I told
              off my brother for making changes to our existing plans or
              schedules &mdash; which I had neatly typed into my Notes
              app.&nbsp;I called his changes &quot;last minute&quot; when, in
              hindsight,&nbsp;this was 8 weeks before the trip. And&nbsp;on I
              whined to him about my time off, and the weather forecasts, and
              the bookings we have to reschedule (even though those were
              harmless changes).<br />
              <br />
              Look, God gave me a patient brother for this very reason.
              But&nbsp;this is why&nbsp;that line in the book was also&nbsp;very
              timely.<br />
              <br />
              Over something as simple as a shift in my original plans,&nbsp;I
              became someone I didn&#39;t want to be, but also someone I
              recognised: Irritable, unwilling to bend, majorly freaks out when
              something isn&#39;t to plan.<br />

                <em>full</em> certainty of what their weaknesses could
                be,&nbsp;is fairly easy, if not transactional. But to consider
                them as an individual with a past and future you don&#39;t fully
                know, with depths you cannot force your way into understanding
