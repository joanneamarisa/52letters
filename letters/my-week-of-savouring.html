              <br />
              My final weeks in Melbourne before flying back home is full of
              savouring. In the knowledge that by this weekend I would be miles
              and miles away, all my morning commutes and mundane tasks are
              awash with sentimentality. (It doesn&#39;t help&nbsp;that every
              street is giving me autumn vibes. What a parting gift!)</span

              ><strong>Sunday: </strong>Two Sundays prior, I was catching up
              with a friend of mine&nbsp;who was also about to depart overseas.
              We meet over brunch and coffee in a place called Journeyman. We
              chat about our jobs, our trips, money, savings. At the end, she
              hugs me goodbye, and it strikes us both that we wouldn&#39;t see
              each other until August.&nbsp;So she hugs me again, a second
              time.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Thursday:&nbsp;</strong>Eight-ish days to go, I make a
              store visit to organise a small event for the company I work for.
              The store manager greets me, and she has the kind
              of&nbsp;unpretentious, affable demeanour that makes you want to be
              her friend. I leave the event smiling. I&#39;m driven back to the
              city by an Uber driver who keeps repeating &quot;Thank you, have a
              nice day, thank you,&quot; &mdash; in polite smiles&nbsp;until
              I&#39;m out of the car.<br />
              <br />
              An hour later, it&#39;s around lunchtime and I&#39;m sitting down
              with my two
              <a href="https://www.datagardenproject.com/">project</a> mentors.
              They take me to a cafe near the campus they teach in, which they
              frequent because it&#39;s &quot;the only place around that speaks
              Italian.&quot;&nbsp;When a girl with a nose piercing brings out
              their regular order (two coffees and a plate of hot chips) my
              mentor responds, &quot;<em>Grazie</em>,&quot; and the girl said
              the same.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Karen and Andy&nbsp;had been my lecturers since my first year of
              uni. In 2018 they taught in one of my first lectures, and I still
              remember Karen&#39;s introduction&nbsp;(&quot;We are partners in
              work&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>in life!&quot;). They taught us about
              the history of design, from ancient Egyptian&nbsp;artefacts to the
              Bauhaus movement in 1920s Germany.&nbsp;We&nbsp;talk about future
              ideas, I ask them for advice, they ask me about my trip, I ask
              them about theirs too (to Italy soon).<br />
              <br />
              They are artists in academia, but because they are artists &mdash;
              often with projects and commissions to finish by a certain
              deadline &mdash; they&#39;re the type of lecturers that&nbsp;say
              things like, &quot;Try not to stress! We also have deadlines. So
              like you, we&#39;ll also be up at 2 AM, crying into our Red
              Bull.&quot; And then they&#39;d laugh, and ask each other
              who&#39;s picking up the kids today. After we say goodbye, I
              continue&nbsp;my work in the library, feeling humbled&nbsp;that I
              get to learn from them&nbsp;in such close proximity.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Friday:&nbsp;</strong>My housemate and I are taking our
              cat to see the groomer. His fur had outgrown and every time
              we&#39;d eat dinner, watching him, we say, &quot;We need to take
              him to a groomer.&quot; We&#39;d been saying this maybe for the
              past half a year, so it was about time.&nbsp;Plus my cat was
              starting&nbsp;to resemble a minuscule lion (but don&#39;t tell him
              I said that.)<br />
              <br />
              That evening, I go to a friend&#39;s apartment for a potluck night
              themed <em>A Taste of Home. </em>We chat, and laugh, eating
              Taiwanese braised pork stew, Indonesian&nbsp;<em>gado-gado</em>,
              and Malaysian-style noodles. My friend had decked out her dining
              table in a way that felt as close to home as possible &mdash; a
              stone clay pot, coasters made of cork, Japanese-style Daiso
              dinnerware, a scented candle, mugs with personalities. We end the
              night with a board game, and she lets me borrow one of her
              suitcases. Again, I walk home that night by the Yarra riverside,
              smiling.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Sunday: </strong>A friend gives me a present, wrapped in
              brown paper with a&nbsp;floral sash and a bow. The envelope reads,
              &quot;<em>Dear Joanne (Happy birthday.)&quot;&nbsp;</em>Like me,
              she is also going away, except neither of us knows for how
              long.&nbsp;Unlike me, she has resigned from her job, and is
              leaving to start&nbsp;a clean slate.&nbsp;So unlike my other
              farewells, this one feels scarier, and less predicted &mdash; I
              don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll see her again. I save the present for
              my actual birthday, but I couldn&#39;t help it; I
              open&nbsp;the&nbsp;card that night.&nbsp;I read her handwriting,
              and by the time&nbsp;I reached her last sentence, I cried.<br />
              <br />
              <strong style="font-style: normal">Tuesday:&nbsp;</strong>The
              weather oscillates between sunny and rain. It&#39;s just Melbourne
              being Melbourne, but it makes me think every sunny morning is the
              last one I get. So I treat it as such. It&#39;s my second-to-last
              day in the office, so I take my time walking to the train station,
              soaking every bit of sunlight.<br />
              <br />
              The cafe I frequent is right across the train station. I do not
              know the owner&#39;s name, nor does he know mine, but this
              morning, he smiles at me in the finally familiar way. They&#39;re
              beginning&nbsp;to remember my order (three days before I leave,
              painfully). The owner hands me my coffee. As always, he says,
              &quot;Have a nice day!&quot; And as always, I smile back,
              &quot;You too!&quot; and rush out the door, crossing the street to
              catch my train.<br />
              <br />
              <strong style="font-style: normal">Wednesday:&nbsp;</strong>I
              visit the same cafe, this time I sit down with some time to spare.
              I order a mocha and the girl serves me a latte, but I don&#39;t
              mind; I think she is new. My assumption proves true when the cafe
              owner &mdash; who&#39;s always behind the coffee machine churning
              out cups and cups of coffee for fellow morning commuters, dog
              walkers, and real estate agents on their way to a&nbsp;showing
              &mdash; started&nbsp;speaking to her.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;You don&#39;t have to be nervous, okay! Just be happy,&quot;
              I overheard him say. &quot;Relax, chat with customers...&quot; The
              girl smiles shyly, and says a few words in response, too quietly
              for me to eavesdrop.<br />
              <br />
              ​&quot;Do you drink coffee, by the way?&quot; cafe owner
              continues,&nbsp;&quot;Would you like one? What would you like?
              I&#39;ll make one for you.&quot; This time I hear her answer,
              &quot;Latte.&quot; &quot;With sugar?&quot; he asks. She nods, and
              on he proceeds to make her a cup.<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;m bad at getting cafe owners&#39; names. There must be a
              category for shy conversationalists, and I&#39;m right in the
              middle of it. I wish I&#39;ve come here many times enough to have
              built this rapport (or the courage to just introduce myself), but
              alas, this will now have to wait until August: When&nbsp;the
              leaves are no longer yellowing, when there&#39;ll be no more dried
              crunchy ones littering the sidewalk. When there&#39;ll be no such
              need to put on so many layers, and maybe sunny days can stay for
              longer than two days.&nbsp;I imagine the train will run on
              its&nbsp;same timetable &mdash; the first one on time, and the
              second exactly 2 minutes late. I imagine the&nbsp;trees &mdash;
              how they&#39;ll all look a little more barren, but with new,
              sprouting leaves, budding in its place.</span

                &quot;​And so he told me his secret formula for happiness. Part
                one of the two-part plan was that I should just get on with
                ordinary life, living it day by day, like anyone else.<br />
                <br />
                But then came part two of Dad&#39;s plan. He told me to live
                every day again almost exactly the same. The first time with all
                the tensions and worries that stop us noticing how sweet the
                world can be, but the second time noticing.<br />
                <br />
                ​And in the end I think I&#39;ve learned the final lesson from
                my travels in time; and I&#39;ve even gone one step further than
                my father did. The truth is I now don&#39;t travel back at all,
                not even for the day. I just try to live every day as if
                I&#39;ve deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as
                if it was the full final day of my extraordinary, ordinary
                life.&quot;<br />
