            <br />
            My Dear&nbsp;Friend,<br />
            <br />
            I read the quote above in the most recent book I finished. (Review
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4695423057">here</a
            >.) What I love about the quote, I think,&nbsp;is its
            sweet&nbsp;balance between relenting to what we can&#39;t control,
            and doing what we can.<br />
            <br />
            Without me realising, we have recently reached the one-year
            anniversary of&nbsp;<em>52 Letters from Jo.&nbsp;</em>The
            <a href="hello-home-starting-anew-1.html"
              >first ever letter I wrote</a
            >
            was sent on 26th March 2022. How the year has flown!<br />
            <br />
            We happened to reach 100 readers throughout this time. So in this
            letter, I personally wanted to thank you for being here, for
            reading, for every kind message or reply you&#39;ve sent in
            response, and simply for giving my words, which are far from
            perfect, a special corner of your inbox every week.<br />
            <br />
            I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t go into a long spiel into why the
            letters exist. I <em>do&nbsp;</em>wish that through
            reading&nbsp;each letter, you may understand why they exist.<br />
            <br />
            But to put it in short: We all need our apple trees. The world is
            crumbling, the honeybees fear for their lives, and nobody&#39;s
            talking to each other anymore. But even if things vanish tomorrow,
            if nothing goes my way, if our earth finally gives way and
            there&#39;s nothing left for us to take for granted, I still want to
            plant my apple tree.<br />
            <br />
            I still want to sow where I can, water as long as my feet allow,
            wait for signs of sapling with every last bit of hope.<br />
            <br />
            And in a very metaphorical way, I hope that explains why I write
            letters.<br />
            <br />
            As I&#39;m writing this to you right now, I&#39;m about an hour away
            from meeting a friend to visit an art exhibition. (So I must start
            getting ready.) But! I didn&#39;t want to miss this chance to thank
            you, and to celebrate our one year and one hundred readers.<br />
            <br />
            On this 36th letter, I&#39;ve opened up a space
            for&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to write a letter too!<br />
            <br />
            It doesn&#39;t have to be a letter to me &mdash; it can be to
            yourself, or to anybody. Some creative prompts: Share a story from
            your life that makes you smile; write a postcard from wherever in
            the world you are now; write a letter to your past or future
            self;&nbsp;raise burning questions about writing, life, or love; ask
            for advice on something that&#39;s been on your mind.<br />
            <br />
            Each response will be anonymous, and&nbsp;handled with great
            care.<br />
            <br />
            <strong
              >You can submit your letter&nbsp;<a
                href="https://forms.gle/fyGVetJAEi9SUxAGA"
                >here</a
              >.</strong
            >
            In the same link, you can also tell me what you&#39;d like to see
            more of from&nbsp;<em>52 Letters from Jo.</em><br />
            <br />
            I can&#39;t wait to read what you write. I&#39;m hoping you do! But
            if not, I&#39;m grateful you&#39;re here either way.<br />
            <br />
            Thank you again. See you in the next one.<br />
            <br />
