            >My Dear Friend,<br />
            <br />
            The last time I spent my birthday at home in Indonesia, I was
            turning 18. It was five years ago; I was also in Bali, on a farewell
            trip with some of my high school friends, and the memory of that
            morning is still as vivid to me as ever.<br />
            <br />
            I woke up in the dark, silent cavern that was our hotel room at 7
            AM, next to 3-4 friends who were still asleep. I didn&#39;t touch my
            phone, and instead reached for a bathing suit, tiptoed out of the
            room, down the stairs, and into the pool, where I spent the next
            hour in a blissful daze.<br />
            <br />
            How fortunate am I to return to the same island, five years later.
            On the morning of my 23rd birthday, I walked along a glossy beach in
            Seminyak, as close as I can get to the ocean.&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure
            what it is about spending birthdays near bodies of water &mdash; how
            healing and euphoric it feels to be reeled in by a different
            gravity, on a day where milestones and memories take on a more
            colossal weight. I think I&#39;d like to keep the tradition.<br />
            <br />
            That morning,&nbsp;I let the waves drench the bottom half of my
            shorts, leaving my legs with dots of sand and saltwater. I think of
            where on earth I&#39;ll be next year. I think of the contrast of
            being 18 versus 23, as illustrated by the water that welcomes me
            &mdash; the pool, this calm, collected, controlled little thing;
            versus the ocean, a gargantuan beast of a character, unpredictable,
            and unashamed.<br />

            Gravity <em>is&nbsp;</em>heavier on land. Only three days later, I
            am on the phone with a friend, sobbing. &quot;Why am I
            <em>like&nbsp;</em>this?&quot; I whined, and at this point I was
            more laughing at myself.<br />
            <br />
            It was a Monday night. My brother had been in town that weekend, and
            Monday was going to be his last night staying with us.&nbsp;I
            hadn&#39;t seen him in years prior, and I&#39;ve been saying to
            myself I&#39;m going to spend as much time with him as I can before
            his wedding day.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            That Monday, though, I don&#39;t know if it was the onslaught of
            cross-continental working, or just the typical plow of a Monday, but
            I mis-planned. I didn&#39;t finish work in time to tag along with
            him to run some wedding errands, which I told him I wanted to do
            since the day before. I forgot to set myself a reminder; I looked at
            the clock and I was 30 minutes late. My brother had to leave, I felt
            guilty, and my brother, laidback and big-hearted, thought nothing of
            it and said, &quot;It&#39;s fine! I&#39;ll see you at home
            tonight.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Somehow I felt even worse.&nbsp;Thirty minutes after my
            brother&#39;s car pulled out of the driveway, my guilt was in
            overdrive.

            I decided to reach out to a friend I can talk to. Shame festers and

            <br />
            It wasn&#39;t the error of timing that struck me. It was how I
            promised to do one thing, and failed to deliver. I said I was going
            to do something, and didn&#39;t do it. Yet this is described

            >For the record, it turned out fine; I went for dinner with friends,
            came back home, and apologised to my brother when I saw him. He
            genuinely didn&#39;t mind, and was even unfazed for the most part.
            The next day we were already sprawled across the dining table with
            our laptops open again, drinking iced coffee while he and his
            fianc&eacute; ask me which colour looks better on the
            invitation.&nbsp;<br style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85)" />
            <br />
            I&#39;m yet to learn to be more compassionate of my own blunders.
            And if I myself were one of the people I told that night, she&#39;d
            say something like: &quot;That actually sounds very human.&quot;
            (And I&#39;d hate that I&#39;m right.)<br />
            <br />
            I share this with you not because I am surprised of my error (quite
            the contrary.) But I&#39;d like to lend you this thought to pocket
            when you do reach milestones or life events, such as turning a new
            age:<br />
            <br />
            The person you want to become, makes mistakes too.<br />
            <br />
            This applies to whether that person is a CEO or simply a better
            sister. I sense that we struggle with the archetypal:&nbsp;<em
              >I thought I&#39;d already be ........... by now.&nbsp;</em
            >And depending on your stage of life, this can be:
            <em>I thought I&#39;d be&nbsp;</em>(manager / CEO / owning a home /
            getting a master&#39;s degree / a better sister / a better friend /
            living elsewhere / in a relationship / having children)&nbsp;<em
              >by now.</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            But ask anyone&#39;s journey of home-buying and they&#39;ll tell you
            what they wish they knew sooner. Ask a seemingly perfect mother and
            she has a laundry list of all the things she&#39;s done horribly
            wrong. The flaw with believing that our life will be &quot;on
            track&quot; once we reach a certain point, is we dismiss the reality
            that all our annoying human-ness will continue to follow us.&nbsp;No
            life change renders you flawless.&nbsp;I can be 18, 23, 45, and I
            still won&#39;t fall short of life lessons I learn the hard way.<br />
            <br />
            One of those&nbsp;lessons that continues to follow me is this: I
            cannot be everything to everyone.<br />
            <br />
            The events of Monday night led me to realise how I&#39;ve been
            struggling with balance in this past 3 weeks.&nbsp;I am not used to
            having to balance work, my own personal life, and family; it has
            always been mainly 2 of the 3.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Prioritising family is much easier to do while living away from
            them, which will sound a bit like a cheat. It&#39;s manageable by
            way of video calls, photo updates, the perpetual group chat... But
            choosing to prioritise family while living with them requires me to
            be more accountable. This includes better planning, better
            making-of-time rather than giving them my &quot;free time&quot;, and
            lots and lots of patience (my 4-year-old niece&nbsp;<em
              style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85)"
              >looooves&nbsp;</em
            >to barge in when I&#39;m just about to start a Zoom meeting.) Did I
            mention loss of personal space, or sacred &quot;quiet&quot; time?
            Yeah, I&#39;ve kissed those things goodbye.<br />
            <br />
            So the lesson, in a more complete sentence might be: I cannot be
            anything to anyone if I am nothing to myself.<br />
            <br />
            Our cup has to be replenished, they say, before we can pour to
            another&#39;s. My decision to fly back home, in case you were
            wondering, stemmed from this thought. It is the most radical
            doing-this-for-myself thing I think I have ever done. A dramatic
            uprooting from a scenic, happy life in Melbourne, yet I knew that if
            I didn&#39;t do it, if I even discounted the desire, I&#39;d
            continue to live there with no ability left to be anything to
            anyone.<br />
            <br />
            And&nbsp;I&#39;ve never felt this happy.&nbsp;It is Saturday in
            sunny Jakarta. We&#39;re taking my brother to a tailor&#39;s
            appointment tomorrow to see him fitted in his wedding suit. The past
            three weeks there are moments where I catch myself smiling stupidly,
            in simple disbelief that I can feel so at home.<br />
            <br />
            I cannot be a perfect sister, daughter, aunt, friend, co-worker,
            employee, all at once.&nbsp;What I can do is apologise for mistakes
            I would inevitably make, be honest with everyone and myself, ask for
            help or support when I need it, and practice to receive love and
            forgiveness on days when I feel least deserving of it.<br

            <br />
            On the Monday night where my guilt was in overdrive, the friend I
            called over the phone listened to me and knew me well enough to
            respond to my distress. &quot;You know I&#39;m not great at
            advice,&quot; she said, &quot;but maybe go take a shower first. I
            don&#39;t know why, but water always seems to help.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            She was right. It does.</span
