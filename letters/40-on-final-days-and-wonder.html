              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I must&#39;ve taken so many walks across Fawkner Park that
              nowadays I float right through it. My feet go from concrete to
              pebbled path and side-step the puddles thoughtlessly. The trees
              still leave me breathless like&nbsp;the first time&nbsp;I came
              here, especially in this last gasp of autumn. Like always, the
              mothers push their prams, and the runners jog, and the dogs heel,
              and the elderly couples take their leisurely time.<br />
              <br />
              Then I pass by a school during what must&#39;ve been recess hour.
              From the distance, I see kids in uniform scattered across the
              playground&mdash;like a joy explosive had erupted in the middle of
              the grass.<br />
              <br />

              her head tilted towards the sky. Another young girl wraps her arms
              around a friend, attempting to lift him off the ground.<br />
              <br />
              I find myself surrounded by all this reckless wonder, and it makes
              me think about youth&mdash;and about mine, in particular.<br />

                laugh, and shudder. I laugh, remembering I, too, was once 4,
                fighting over who gets to go on the slide first. I, too, was
                once the angsty age of&nbsp;15, convinced that everything I was

              >Now at 23, I recognise there&#39;s enough space in the world for
              everybody, and that everything I&#39;m feeling is as universal as
              it is personal.<br />
              <br />
              Yet I shudder, because perhaps youth&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>as
              fast, as slippery, as the world suggests. That like sand,&nbsp;it
              may escape your grasp if you don&#39;t cling to it tightly.<br />
              <br />
              But I want to explore a different meaning. I want to treat my
              youth as clay. Like playdough, I want these &quot;younger
              years&quot; to be something&nbsp;I can stretch, and curl up, and
              mold into anything I want. I want to fold its marbled colours
              together, letting it mesh into grey goo, only to introduce to it
              new colours to brighten up again. I want to roll it out, like
              pizza, letting it reach the furthest edges of my table.<br />
              <br />
              My time&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>running out&mdash;play
              time&nbsp;<em>isn&#39;t&nbsp;</em>forever&mdash;so I&#39;d like to
              have as much fun as I can in the process.<br />
              <br />
              And when I stop looking at my youth like&nbsp;that slipping sand,
              and instead as this malleable, colourful thing, I feel less of
              that panic of wondering whether I am on the obscure &quot;right
              track&quot;, or whether I have made myself&nbsp;loveable,
              successful, worthy enough in the time I have spent.<br />
