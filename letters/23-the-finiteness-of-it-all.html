              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;m going to tell you something &ndash; but you have
              to&nbsp;<em>promise&nbsp;</em>not to make fun of me. And not to
              laugh. (Although it&#39;s not like I&#39;d be able to tell.)<br />
              <br />
              Every morning when I go to work, I take the Frankston train that
              runs southeast from the city. When the train nears Ormond station
              &ndash; which is where I stop &ndash; it passes by an oval
              football field placed in the centre of an otherwise quaint, boring
              old neighbourhood.<br />
              <br />
              Not a lot happens on it &mdash;&nbsp;9 AM on Mondays to Wednesdays
              is probably too early in the day and week for anything exciting.
              But I make a point to look at it. For some reason, every
              morning&nbsp;I remind myself to always look out to this
              empty&nbsp;football field on my way to work.<br />
              <br />
              Unremarkable as it may be &mdash;&nbsp;save that a mum is there
              with a&nbsp;stroller or someone is playing frisbee with their
              Labrador &mdash; it has&nbsp;become sort of a morning ritual.
              A&nbsp;good luck charm, maybe, if you will.<br />
              <br />
              If I don&#39;t &mdash; like this morning, as I was too entrenched
              in
              <a
                href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55457493-the-man-who-died-twice"
                >my book</a
              >
              &mdash; I feel a bit at odds. Silly, of course,&nbsp;I doubt the
              universe conspires against me because I forgot to look at a
              specific spot outside a train window. But we all constantly
              look&nbsp;for something to cling onto, don&#39;t we?<br />
              <br />
              Anyway, so why am I telling you this now?<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;ve written to you before about
              <a href="my-week-of-savouring.html">noticing</a>. How in my final
              weeks before leaving Melbourne, I clung onto every piece
              that&nbsp;I could. There will always be&nbsp;something a bit
              endearing, a bit heartbreaking, about noticing. But we
              can&#39;t&nbsp;help it. We savour every moment, especially
              when&nbsp;we&#39;re confronted by the finiteness of it
              all.&nbsp;</span

              Well, 10 months, 2 weeks, and 2 days to be exact. I shall be on a
              (one-way) plane well before then, passing duty-free aisles like
              any other tourist. Except this time, as I pretend to browse for
              travel neck pillows and candy bars at WHSmith, I&#39;d
              be&nbsp;quietly bracing myself for another significant life
              leap.<br />
              <br />
              To tell you the truth, I am wildly elated. At the same time,

                The potential impact of loss or change may daunt us, and urge us
                to hide, escape, or numb and protect ourselves. I&#39;m
                proposing, I guess, to go <em>towards</em> the wave. That the
                impact will hit you, in fact&nbsp;<em>harder</em>, but may we
                never be so distracted by possible losses that we lose sight of
                what has always been present.<br />

              noticing. A year that I&#39;m determined to come out of on the

                  here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not
                  much more clothe you&mdash;you of little faith? So do not
                  worry, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What
                  shall we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear?&rsquo;
                  [For] your heavenly Father knows that you need them.&nbsp;<br />
                  <br />
