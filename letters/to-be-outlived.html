            My Dear Friend,<br />
            <br />
            Two things happened last weekend. First, I went to the city to watch
            <em>Hamilton</em> on Sunday night. Second, I finished my Jodi
            Picoult book (and may or may not have devoured its last 300 pages in
            the span of 3 days).<br />
            <br />
            These are 2 separate stories: one about a founding father of
            America, and the other about a survivor of the Holocaust. Before I
            tell you why they&#39;ve been on my mind, may I introduce you to
            them both?<br />
            &nbsp;

            >Alexander Hamilton is the protagonist of
            <em>Hamilton,</em>&nbsp;the show that I was watching. From his youth
            to his role in US history, the one thing you <em>really</em> need to
            know about him is this: He was obsessed with legacy. He wrote many
            essays and introduced himself to every leader he could find.
            Power-hungry, perhaps, but like many of us, the man just wanted to
            be known for a long time.<br />
            <br />
            My second character, the one who resides in the pages of my book, is
            Minka. Minka is also a writer. She is over 80 years old, and when
            she was a teenager in Germany, she survived the Holocaust as a
            prisoner in Auschwitz.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Before the Nazis took over, Minka loved literature and was in fact
            writing her own fantasy novel. She knew her novel by heart, and one
            night, she was sat in her bunker when her best friend, Darija, had a
            toothache. As Darija was groaning with pain in a bunker filled with
            40 other Jewish women, Minka wanted to cheer her up, so she began
            reciting her novel out loud.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Our home was made of river stone,&quot; she started, &quot;the
            hearth where my father baked heated the entire cottage.&nbsp;<em
              >I don&#39;t want a summer funeral, Ania,&nbsp;</em
            >he would say.&nbsp;<em
              >Make sure instead I die on a cool day when there&#39;s a nice
              breeze.</em
            >&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            As she was telling her story, Minka realised the whole room had gone
            quiet. All the women, with their own aching wounds and fading hope
            in that camp, were listening.<br />
            <br />
            Two stories of two storytellers. And why do we tell stories, if not
            for the hope that our receivers may remember them? Both left me
            circling around a question:
            <em
              style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85)"
              >When I leave this world, what outlives me? On my final day, what
              would I wish I could&#39;ve done?</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            I ask these questions not to daunt myself with mortality, but to ask
            in full curiosity: If it won&#39;t be the thing I think about when I
            am on my deathbed, should it really matter <em>that</em> much? It
            clearly applies to larger questions around our careers, love lives,
            et cetera. But I find it boils down to the trivial little things
            too: I want to wear this pink jacket and am too scared to. But at
            the end of my life, would it really
            matter&nbsp;so<em>&nbsp;</em>much? I bet 90-year-old me
            would&nbsp;<em>kill&nbsp;</em>to look 23 in a bright pink
            jacket.&nbsp;So I wear it. Both because life is short, and also
            because how I look on the streets is so easily outshone by a million
            other things that happen on a street.<br />
            <br />
            Questions around legacy lends a new weight to my perspective of what
            matters, and what doesn&#39;t. Which helps, because the world does
            such a terrific job in confusing me between the two.<br />

                onto. Something to remember you by. I do hope these postcards

                Maya Angelou quote that says, &quot;People will forget what you
                said, people will forget what you&nbsp;did, but people will
                never forget how you made them feel.&quot; I am laden with
                faults&nbsp;&mdash; so&nbsp;my application of this is far from
                perfect &mdash;&nbsp;but I still stubbornly believe in the power
                of asking about someone&#39;s day, expressing&nbsp;that they
                mean a lot&nbsp;to me, or stating&nbsp;that they&#39;re doing a
                good job.&nbsp;In my core I know that allowing people to feel
                seen&nbsp;<em>does&nbsp;</em>matter, both now and in the long
                run. I recognise that that&#39;s all Minka was doing. Trying to
                make her best friend feel better. As a result, 40 women found
                the strength to live just another day.</span

            It is&nbsp;both a profound calling, and a comforting thought.
            Profound, because it means there is importance in mending the broken
            relationship, in saying &quot;I love you&quot; first, in apologising
            or forgiving, in reaching out to someone in need.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            At the same time, comforting, because it means we don&#39;t have to
            survive a war or found a nation to be able to have a legacy. We can
            simply live, and live fully. Saying &quot;hi&quot; to a co-worker
            does not feel special any minute you say it, but not hearing it one
            morning is how they notice your absence. Sitting across a dinner
            table from someone&nbsp;and engaging eye contact can be
            nerve-wracking if not a little awkward, which we so naturally evade
            with our phones, but if 80 years from now they are old and grey and
            the only memory they have of you is that dinner &mdash; if all they
            could remember from you are your eyes, and the way you listened
            &mdash; wouldn&#39;t that be grand?&nbsp;<br />
