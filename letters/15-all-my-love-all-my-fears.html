              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Do you remember when I wrote to you a few months ago, about how,
              leading up to my departure from Melbourne, my weeks were
              <a href="my-week-of-savouring.html">full of savouring</a>?
              Well&nbsp;today, I&#39;m three&nbsp;weeks away from returning to
              Melbourne&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&#39;m experiencing similar
              effects,&nbsp;tenfold.<br />
              <br />
              First of all, I must apologise for not writing to you sooner.
              Three days after my brother&#39;s wedding, my temperature spiked
              and I was bedridden with a fever and cough for days.&nbsp;Every
              test came back negative which was strange, but now &mdash; a week
              later &mdash; four of my family members tested positive. So here I
              am, floating in limbo as one of the negative odd ones out in the
              family. Grateful, if not cautious and a little puzzled as I occupy
              a half-empty home.<br />
              <br />
              Being ever so mellow, when I was down with a fever, I scrolled
              through photos on my gallery to pass the time. Glimpses of my
              first month at home&nbsp;include:<span

              The way my back aches from too much laughter. There was a moment
              after the wedding where we were gathered as a big family &mdash;
              and we joked about everything from kids to wedding guests
              to&nbsp;my aunts and uncles&#39; shenanigans during the ceremony.
              There are snacks on the coffee table, and a faint smell of
              cigarettes, and&nbsp;we laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and the
              memory fills me with a love that could last me many years.<br />
              <br />
              Witnessing my brother and his new wife, and also my sister and her
              partner. How lucky I feel to have &quot;teachers&quot;&nbsp;of
              what a healthy love looks like: Laughing at, and laughing with.
              Giving generous room to grow. Letting each other&#39;s
              strengths&nbsp;and weaknesses meet,&nbsp;and form a team.</span

              vows.<br />
              <br />
              A lot can emerge in wedding planning; disagreements, anxieties,
              the occasional COVID scares... The point, perhaps, is not a day of
              flawless scenarios. The point, perhaps, is love and presence. Both
              the offering and the receiving.&nbsp;<br />

              I realise I don&#39;t want to miss a minute. I don&#39;t want to
              miss the things that could excite, nor devastate me. Both on that
              day, and in life with my family in general.</span

              >When I say&nbsp;<em>family,</em>&nbsp;we may think of blood
              relations within the confines of some arbitrary family tree.
              But&nbsp;I consider that family is whomever&nbsp;I can
              show&nbsp;all my love, all my fears, with the space wide enough in
              their hearts&nbsp;to hold it. They are those who
              recognise&nbsp;our faults, yet love us unconditionally. Whose
              faces come to mind? Isn&#39;t it true that we choose families too?
              The parent with whom I share my breakfasts, the friend I can talk
              about anything to,&nbsp;the two<em>&nbsp;</em>roommates in
              Melbourne who, by odd and wondrous miracle, have become more like
              my&nbsp;sisters.<br />
              <br />
              The least we can offer to those who matter to us is presence. The
              least we can receive from them,&nbsp;regardless of whether or not
              we feel deserving of&nbsp;it, is love.<br />

              I pack&nbsp;my bags this weekend, and&nbsp;I&#39;m less
              preoccupied nowadays with defining where home is.&nbsp;Instead, I
              take comfort in being&nbsp;stretched between many. I decide that
              home is wherever a love like this can find me, freely.</span
