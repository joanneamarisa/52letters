              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I feel like when you haven&#39;t done something in a long while,
              and then you decide to get back to doing it again, what
              we&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>feel is proud. Proud for giving
              ourselves another chance. Brave, for not giving up on us. But
              instead, what we as a society tends to feel, is shame.
              Embarrassment for not having gone to the gym in too long, or sense
              of failure&nbsp;about &mdash; *ahem* &mdash; not having written
              any letters in a month&#39;s time.<br />
              <br />
              So here I am, writing to you, as a way to combat that
              self-critical ghoul that tells me I&#39;m a horrible person for
              not trying hard enough. I want to say November was a whirlwind,
              and that I&#39;ve had to make space for other things, which is
              true, but being forgiving on myself shouldn&#39;t require an
              excuse. We shouldn&#39;t need excuses for our shortcomings to
              determine whether or not we should be nice to ourselves.<br />
              <br />
              So I say this, actually, because it has a little to do with my
              letter today.<br />
              <br />
              At the train station when I get home from work, I sometimes take
              the elevator to get from the station&#39;s entrance to the train
              platform downstairs.<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>silly &mdash; literally all you
              have to do is go down&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>flight of stairs and
              you reach the train, and the stairs<em>&nbsp;is</em> how I get to
              and from the platform everyday.<br />
              <br />
              But there are some days &ndash; like this particular day &ndash;
              where I walk to the station with my head down. Mind fuming after
              work, that faint and drained 5pm feeling we 9-to-5 fighters know
              all too well. When I&#39;m feeling that bit
              more...&nbsp;<em>downtrodden&nbsp;</em>(for lack of a less ancient
              word), my inner critic is far less friendly, and that commute home
              feels a bit more challenging. I feel like I just want to cocoon
              and hide and&nbsp;just&nbsp;<em>be</em>.<br />
              <br />
              Hence, I once in a while find myself standing on that empty
              elevator for 3-4 seconds, coming down&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>floor
              to take me to a platform I could&#39;ve easily reached on my
              own.<br />
              <br />
              Why? Because I can. Because no reason at all. Because I&#39;m
              feeling like I need a hug or a bed and I couldn&#39;t get to that
              just yet, so the comforting convenience of an elevator will have
              to do.<br />
              <br />
              Shortly after, I came across&nbsp;a TED Talk titled
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1O_MjMRkPg&ab_channel=TEDxTalks"
                ><em>How to do laundry when you&#39;re depressed</em></a
              >. In it, KC Davis proposes a simple, yet profound connection
              between cleaning tasks and&nbsp;mental health. Because isn&#39;t
              it true that when we&#39;re dipped in grief, burnout, stress, or
              anxiety, we can forget what it&#39;s like to vacuum our floors or
              make our bed? Aren&#39;t there days when the little things are not
              so little?<br />

                >They don&#39;t make you a good person, or a bad person. An
                organised closet doesn&#39;t make you a success. A pile of
                laundry on the floor doesn&#39;t make you a failure.&quot;</span
              ><br />
              <br />
              How long it has been since you last cleaned your bedroom,
              doesn&#39;t make you more or less worthy of a functional space.
              How long it has been since you last did your laundry, or cleaned
              the dishes, makes you no more or&nbsp;less worthy, than the
              ability to eat, and to sleep in clean sheets.<br />
              <br />
              Later that week, I went out with a few friends of mine&nbsp;to
              grab ice cream with one of our former lecturers. We sat at the
              park, and our lecturer was telling us about her PhD research on
              food waste. My friend then said, &quot;That&#39;s so true! Young
              couples probably waste food a lot. My partner and I, we call them
              <i>jank&nbsp;</i>meals &mdash; you basically throw anything you
              find from the fridge into a meal. And that&#39;s
              a&nbsp;<em>jank&nbsp;</em>meal. But it works.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              It works. Because when you can&#39;t cook, you put fried rice into
              a wrap or you pair a half-sandwich with a packet of chips.<br />
              <br />
              Because when you can&#39;t take a shower,&nbsp;&quot;you take a
              packet of wet wipes,&quot; Davis says in her TED talk,
              &quot;because no matter how you&#39;re feeling, you still deserve
              to be clean.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Go for the unorthodox ways of taking care of yourself if that
              means&nbsp;<em>still&nbsp;</em>taking care of yourself, whatever
              that may look like.<br />
              <br />
              If I can&#39;t find it in me to run whole laps today, I&#39;m
              going to have to make peace with my yoga mat sprawled on the lawn
              outside. (I&#39;ll sit and stretch or something, I don&#39;t
              know?) If I can&#39;t bring myself to change my bed sheets,
              I&#39;ll settle on just my pillowcase or I&#39;ll grab a different
              blanket.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Give yourself permission to do a little.&quot; So here I am,
              friends. Doing a little. Doing what I can.<br />
