              >My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I have a confession to make. My apartment is in a perpetual state
              of mess, and has been so for the past month at least.<br />
              <br />
              For my 24th birthday, I asked my friends to buy me a dresser for
              my bedroom, knowing the apartment I&#39;m in doesn&#39;t have
              enough built-in storage, and I have no furniture to compensate. So
              they&nbsp;picked for me a beautiful white-and-wooden&nbsp;6-shelf
              dresser that will perfectly store all my clothes...<br />
              <br />
              <em>once it&#39;s assembled.</em><br />
              <br />
              The reality is that the gift arrived in my doorstep shortly before
              my birthday in June, and then I flew to Singapore for a long
              weekend, chased to catch up&nbsp;with work, and was juggling 2-3
              other things at once.<br />
              <br />
              So what became of this beautiful dresser? Well, I did the work of
              <em>unpacking</em> the dresser from its box one day, and called it
              progress.&nbsp;I did a headcount of all the numbered panels of
              wood, metal rods, and little plastic bags filled with screws and
              littler parts, and called <em>that&nbsp;</em>progress. I organised
              them from 1-12&mdash;and yes, it&#39;s a 12-step manual&mdash;and
              left it there, so in other words: Not a lot of progress... For
              weeks I have lived with these random blocks of an unfinished
              furniture, strewn across the hallway that leads to my
              apartment.<br />
              <br />
              Then&nbsp;a friend of mine suggested to come and spend the evening
              for a visit.<br />
              <br />
              And as per the Disney Pixar movie&nbsp;<em>Inside Out&nbsp;</em
              >when chaos erupted in the cockpit, red sirens and all, all my
              little emotions went to sheer panic mode:&nbsp;<em
                >Ahhhh no no no no, I&#39;m not ready I&#39;m not ready I&#39;m
                not ready!!! </em
              ><br />
              <br />
              (My tall, lanky Fear, most of all.)<br />
              <br />
              But as I sat with it, I pondered again on how I was feeling.
              Because up until then&nbsp;I had only planned to invite them
              once&mdash;<em>and only once&mdash;</em>I had finished this
              Goliath-task dresser.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              And I asked myself again: <em>Why?</em> I felt adequately ready
              for them to see my apartment;&nbsp;in fact, I&#39;ve had friends
              see my apartment before. Sure, it&nbsp;could always use another
              vacuum, the coffee table and my work desk could always be neater,
              and&nbsp;sure, I have yet to learn the concept of a
              &quot;tidy&quot; rack to place my shoes, and the plate from which
              I ate my last meal might still sit in the bottom of my sink.<br />
              <br />
              But it is as much of a home as any. I myself have stepped into
              some messy apartments of my friends&#39; before. Like
              lone-sock-on-the-living-room-floor,
              tower-of-dishes-that-hits-the-sink-faucet messy&mdash;and no! Of
              course these did&nbsp;not<em>&nbsp;</em>scare me off from our
              friendship, ick me to the point that I had to leave, or even make
              me think of my friends any less. Friendships well withstand messy
              homes!<br />
              <br />
              So why was it that I was there, across from a friend who was as
              open and understanding and close to me as anybody, feeling an
              insane amount of embarrassment&nbsp;for this dresser that had not
              been finished? Ashamed over a cardboard box and a few panels of
              wood that sit against the wall of my hallway? What had repulsed me
              about the idea of somebody coming into my home
              <em>before&nbsp;</em>it was perfect? Simply because my home was,
              at that given time, a&nbsp;<em>work in progress</em>?<br />
              <br />
              This leads me to a deeper question about a tendency I didn&#39;t
              know I had, until a couple of my close friends had pointed it out
              to me in the past:<br />
              <br />
              &quot;You know, Jo, every time you share something to us...
              it&#39;s always really... <em>polished</em>. It&#39;s not a bad
              thing, it&#39;s good! But also... you know you&#39;re allowed
              to&nbsp;<em>vent,&nbsp;</em>right?&quot;<br />
              <br />
              I remember being flabbergasted by this comment.<br />
              <br />
              <em>Because wouldn&#39;t that be...</em
              >&nbsp;<em>irresponsible?&nbsp;</em>I thought.&nbsp;&quot;I vent
              to you all the time!&quot; I retaliated. &quot;I feel like I even
              share&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>much already, to the point of
              becoming a burden.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              And my friends quickly shook their heads, &quot;Not at all! When
              you share, sometimes it feels like your problems are neatly
              wrapped. It already has a story, resolved with a beginning to end.
              But, you don&#39;t have to be so put together and
              polished.&nbsp;You <em>can</em> be open, and just pour it
              out.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              <strong
                >You&nbsp;can<em>&nbsp;</em>be open, and just pour it
                out.</strong
              ><br />
              <br />
              So, Friend, I suppose that deeper question I was referring to was
              this: Where did we learn that we need to pull ourselves together,
              appear or become perfect, before we can let anyone in?<br />
              <br />
              Going back to present time, I soon found it comical&mdash;that my
              genuine&nbsp;plan of action earlier last month&nbsp;was to&nbsp;<i
                >single-handedly build this dresser myself</i
              >&nbsp;(even though the instruction manual says it needs a
              2-person assembly!), and only then will I&nbsp;begin inviting my
              friends into my apartment again. You know, once I&#39;ve finished
              it, and all the cardboard is thrown out, and I have changed over
              my rugs, and I have upgraded my vacuum to give it a deeper clean,
              and I have wiped every surface of any speck of dust the eye can
              see...<br />
              <br />
              How exhausting! It would&#39;ve been close to
              my&nbsp;<em>25th&nbsp;</em>birthday before I&#39;d invite anybody
              in,&nbsp;it sounds like.<br />
              <br />
              Where did I learn to never let anybody see the &quot;chaos&quot;?
              Whether it be a messy apartment, a complex set of emotions,
              thoughts in my head I have yet to untangle?<br />
              <br />
              Some of us grow up with this armour-like mechanism. Because of
              course, vulnerability is the least preferred, and more difficult,
              route. Pouring your heart out puts you at greater risk of
              &quot;the wrong reaction&quot;, the way I felt that my messy
              apartment would put me at risk of judgment.<br />
              <br />
              As a result, something I unearthed in a recent therapy session was
              that I invite people into difficult times (even my most trusted
              people) only when I am&nbsp;&frac34; of the way through a problem.
              If the average difficulty I had in my life was a hill, it would be
              once I get&nbsp;<em>past&nbsp;</em>the peak that I share what
              I&#39;m going through with somebody else.&nbsp;</span

              >Sometimes, I even only confide in them when I&#39;m all the way
              through, and the hill is well behind me.&nbsp;Through therapy, I
              learned this habit can be exhausting. Because doesn&#39;t that
              mean I&#39;m trudging up that hill, all by myself, all the time?
              Doesn&#39;t that mean I&#39;m insistent on living out the
              more&nbsp;challenging, the&nbsp;more uncertain,&nbsp;the messier
              aspects of my human experience, all on my own?<br />
              <br />
              My therapist said, &quot;My advice to you, Jo, would be

              <br />
              Because this unfinished dresser is much like the many other
              Goliath-sized tasks we may encounter: navigating changes, tough
              relationships and conversations, and any form of complicatedness
              we may find ourselves in as we become adults. Even the
              Goliath-sized task of taking care of ourselves, sometimes!
              Especially when life gets tough and our mood or state of mind
              suggests anything but.<br />
              <br />
              The way my therapist described it is: Taking care of ourselves is
              a Swiss army knife. Self-regulating and figuring it out on your
              own, is one blade in a set of blades. At times it is helpful! But
              there are other tools to use. Opening up, being vulnerable, asking
              for help, are equally&nbsp;helpful tools. And most of the time,
              they are tools that you will also have at your disposal. Using
              only one blade from your whole toolkit for every single task would
              be ineffective, and yes, of course tiresome.<br />
              <br />
              So I went home that evening, and texted my friend.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Are you free to come over to my apartment to help me build
              this dresser?&quot; I asked.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Of course!&quot; she said in response.<br />
