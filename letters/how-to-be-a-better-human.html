              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              On days where I feel exceptionally inspired to self-improve, I
              listen to this TED podcast called&nbsp;<em
                >How to be a Better Human.&nbsp;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              I often need it because&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;hard
              to&nbsp;human&nbsp;sometimes.&nbsp;In this new, post-pandemic
              world, there are days where I don&#39;t feel quite like myself. Do
              you feel that way too? My pastor said earlier last week: Whether
              we like it or not, we are simply&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>the same
              people that we were before the pandemic.&nbsp;It&#39;s hard to
              deny this&nbsp;even as we move through the world; there&#39;s a
              sense of fatigue and collective overwhelm even as we settle back
              to happy normalcy.<br />
              <br />
              One morning on my walk &mdash; we&#39;re&nbsp;still in
              freezing&nbsp;<a href="autumn-and-impermanence.html">autumn</a
              >&mdash; I listened to an episode called&nbsp;<em
                >How to nurture your emotional agility. </em
              >I didn&#39;t know what that meant,
              but&nbsp;<em>agility&nbsp;</em>sounded fascinating; like a dog
              show where they jump through hoops and fences or something.<br />
              <br />
              The speaker is Susan David,&nbsp;psychologist and author of the
              book&nbsp;<em
                >Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change and Thrive in
                Work and Life.</em
              >&nbsp;&quot;Emotional agility,&quot; she describes, &quot;is the
              ability to be with our thoughts, emotions and stories in ways that
              use these as important pieces of data about the things we care
              about.&quot; It&#39;s phrased as agility<em>&nbsp;</em>because
              this process enables us to navigate life&#39;s many twists and
              turns. (I&#39;d say a pandemic can count as a Strong Twist
              and&nbsp;Turn.)<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s timely, because&nbsp;I&#39;ve grown tired of the abstract
              concepts we use to talk about emotions.&nbsp;I can describe them
              all day long and not run out of metaphors;&nbsp;clouds, leaves,
              little gremlins, what have you. But post-pandemic pragmatic Jo
              demands,&nbsp;<em
                >Do you have something to teach me or not?&nbsp;</em
              >And as it turns out, they do.</span

            <strong>Exercise 1: Signposts</strong><br />

              >First, reflect&nbsp;on these past 24 months,&nbsp;from the
              beginning of the pandemic until today.&nbsp;If you were to take a
              piece of paper&nbsp;and write down one word that describes the
              emotion you&#39;ve been feeling&nbsp;(or what you feel now) in
              this time, what would that be?<br />
              <br />
              The word might be
              <i>grief, loneliness, boredom, contentment, wonder...&nbsp;</i>And
              afterwards, turn your paper over and consider: What needs and
              values is this word signalling to?&nbsp;For example, if&nbsp;your
              word is <em>b</em><em>oredom</em>, you might be someone who values
              growth. If it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>loneliness,</em>&nbsp;you might be
              someone who needs connection or genuine intimacy, and is not
              experiencing much of it in this time. Emotions signpost
              to&nbsp;whether or not our needs are being met, and whether or not
              our values are reflected in our current experiences.<br />
              <br />
              My word was&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html"
                ><em>languished</em></a
              >, which surprised me that it was the first word that came to
              mind, since it&#39;s a relatively new term that I don&#39;t even
              use in my everyday vocabulary. The synonyms for it are stagnation
              or purposelessness.&nbsp;And this signposts that&nbsp;I&#39;m
              someone who values purpose &mdash; abstract as that word may
              be.<br />
              <br />
              One of the hard things I&#39;ve had to reckon with in my
              &#39;languishing&#39; this year&nbsp;was admitting that, at one
              point,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;unhappy. Life can be beautiful filled with
              things and people you&#39;re grateful for, and yet you may still
              feel a longing to the point of sorrow.&nbsp;In my case, it was
              starting to show.&nbsp;Writing a feeling down on a piece of paper
              may seem trite, but this reckoning is important in deciding where
              we go next.&nbsp;<br />

                >Exercise 2: Micro actions</span
              ><br />
              <br />
              The&nbsp;word &quot;values&quot;&nbsp;sounds like the type of
              thing companies hang up in their offices to motivate
              employees.&nbsp;<span
                style="
                  color: rgb(85, 85, 85);

                  font-weight: 400;
                "
                >We stick them up in our office too, however one of the things
                my director said was this: &quot;You can&#39;t put values on a
                PowerPoint slide.&nbsp;They&#39;re not something you present to
                somebody &ndash; they have to be lived. They don&#39;t need to
                hear it from us&nbsp;or see it on the wall whatever, they have
                to feel it by working here.&quot;</span
              ><br style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85)" />
              <br />
              I thought it was profound. Susan David says,
              &quot;Values&nbsp;are&nbsp;a quality of action.&nbsp;Each day
              we&nbsp;choose between actions that either moves towards our
              values, or away from it.&quot; She suggests something she
              phrased&nbsp;as&nbsp;<em>repetitive micro-moments</em>. If you
              value a&nbsp;relationship, for example, it is built by simple acts
              like giving them a hug every few mornings.<br />
              <br />
              Suggesting &quot;small, consistent actions&quot; may finally veer
              this letter into self-help-book territory (it&#39;s probably
              already there), however my favourite part of the phrase
              is&nbsp;<em>micro-moments.</em>&nbsp;If you are wondering where in
              your life your values and needs are not being met, think of the
              moments you don&#39;t think matter, because normally that&#39;s
              where we can start doing things a little differently.<br />
              <br />
              For instance, my quest for &quot;purpose&quot; sounds&nbsp;like a
              mountainous task, so&nbsp;I ask,&nbsp;<em
                >What would be a micro-moment&nbsp;that reassures me I&#39;m
                right where I&#39;m meant to be?&nbsp;</em
              >You&#39;ll never guess where I found it: in the stories
              of&nbsp;friends. Each time a friend shares to me something from
              their lives &mdash; and this can be anything from a fact to an
              anecdote to a whole unraveling of something they&#39;ve been going
              through &mdash;&nbsp;I make space for this to be held, and I
              cradle it like a newborn baby. There is weight in each one, but
              there is also a deep well of love and gratitude for the fact that
              they&#39;ve&nbsp;entrusted me&nbsp;with it.&nbsp;<span

              paying&nbsp;deep attention&nbsp;that we&nbsp;realise
              the&nbsp;significance of moments otherwise overlooked &mdash;
              moments that can make us better.<br />

              Finally, I might end with&nbsp;another idea Susan David suggested:

              &nbsp;</span

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &quot;In a world where we&#39;re in a never-ending competition,
              self compassion may feel like you are weak or lazy or lying to
              yourself. That you&#39;re letting yourself &#39;off the hook&#39;.
              But it&#39;s simply the recognition that it is hard to human.
              Every single one of us is being asked to human in a way that
              doesn&#39;t come with a playbook. A core component of our capacity
              to be healthy is to see yourself as a being in that struggle. How
              might we do this? I invite you to ask yourself: What does the
              5-year-old in me need right now? Are they asking to be seen, to be
              loved, to feel worthy? To have spontaneity and joy?&quot;

              >To tell you the truth, I grapple with these &quot;inner
              child&quot; advices because it&#39;s a&nbsp;running joke that
              childhood is the scapegoat every therapist uses. But what Susan is
              referring to is something called, in psychological practice,
              the&nbsp;<em>continuity of the self.&nbsp;</em><br />
              <br />
              We all carry younger versions of ourselves within us&nbsp;to a
              certain extent, and these younger selves have hopes, dreams, and
              aspirations that may have dissipated as we grew older. They
              probably&nbsp;clash with our older, more responsible selves
              who&nbsp;thinks far more rationally and tends&nbsp;to rein back
              our own desires. Continuity is about strengthening that
              thread&nbsp;by keeping our sense of hope and wonder alive, without
              necessarily being the ballerina/astronaut our 5-year-old dreams
              dictated.<br />
              <br />
              Say your chosen word was&nbsp;<em>boredom,&nbsp;</em>and as
              someone who values growth, your micro-moment of choice is
              listening to self-help podcasts while you do
              time-consuming&nbsp;chores around the house. You add a splash of
              delight, so every couple of instances, you replace the podcast
              with a Beyonc&eacute; album. You dance like the person in a vacuum
              commercial. You level up in silly, but also in delight.<br />
              <br />
              Adopting the whimsical way a 5-year-old thinks and acts around
              themselves and the world&nbsp;is a practice in lending ourselves
              the compassion to loosen our own rigidity&nbsp;around what we feel
              we should do. Again, there is no playbook. And it&#39;s a long
              journey to rebuild. We might as well make it worthwhile,
              right?</span
