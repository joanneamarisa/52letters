            <br />
            Last night, I was<em>&nbsp;</em>part of the&nbsp;chorus of 90,000
            Swifties belting out the words to <em>Long Live</em>, shaking the
            insides of Melbourne Cricket Ground.<br />
            <br />
            As the way I often feel when listening to any of Taylor&#39;s older
            records, standing there in a crowd of light-up bracelets and
            flawlessly bedazzled people, I felt waves of nostalgia.<br />
            <br />
            Though I
            love&nbsp;<i>folklore&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Lover</em>&nbsp;and her
            newer albums, it&#39;s always tracks from&nbsp;<em
              >Speak Now, Fearless</em
            >, or her debut, that always gets to me. It takes me right back to
            sitting in the car on my way to school, or my way
            home&nbsp;<em>from&nbsp;</em>school, as we decked out the dashboard
            with all of her CDs. (I would be flipping through her CD cover
            booklets to look at the photos and lyrics&mdash;<em
              >remember those</em
            >??)<br />
            <br />
            Nostalgia is something I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about
            lately.&nbsp;<span

              <br />
              Row to row, variations of myself smiled back at me. It is
              February, and I am beaming after successfully assembling a couch
              for the first time. It&#39;s May, and my friend and I are sitting
              across each other, laughing, sipping wine after watching a show.
              It&#39;s November, and I am reading a book at a beach and that was
              probably the only time in the entire year that I read a book at a
              beach.</span

                  >&quot;You may believe that living life to the fullest is
                  seeing every country in the world and quitting your job on a
                  whim and falling recklessly in love, but it&#39;s really just
                  knowing how to be where your feet are.<br />
                  <br />
                  It&#39;s learning how to take care of yourself, how to make a
                  home within your own skin. How to build a simple life you are
                  proud of. A life most fully lived is not always composed of
                  the things that rock you awake, but those that slowly assure
                  you it&#39;s okay to slow down. That you don&#39;t always have
                  to prove yourself. That you don&#39;t need to fight forever,
                  or constantly want more. That it&#39;s okay for things to be
                  just as they are.<br />
                  <br />
                  Little by little, you will begin to see that life can only
                  grow outward in proportion to how stable it is
                  inward&mdash;that if the joy is not in the little things
                  first, the big things won&#39;t fully find us.&quot;<br />

            overarchingly, I can admit that I spent a lot of 2023 trying to
            solve or &quot;get through&quot; the hard stuff, often forgetting to
            be grateful for the good stuff.<br />
            <br />
            And we can live the rest of our lives like this, if we are not
            careful. We often think that missing out on life is not landing that
            job, not getting to go on that trip, not going to that bar with
            those friends, not reaching the goals we&#39;ve set for ourselves to
            feel like we &quot;made it&quot;.<br />
            <br />
            Now entering my mid-twenties, I have a different view on what
            missing out really is. It&#39;s failing to notice that there&#39;s
            always something to be grateful for. That
            life&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>good&mdash;not always perfect, neither
            will we make perfect decisions, but life&#39;s always&nbsp;<em
              >at least a little&nbsp;</em
            >good in each passing minute&mdash;and if we can&#39;t see it today,
            our nostalgic future selves will see it crystal clearly.&nbsp;<br />

            When I ask a person who is a few years older than me for advice,
            they may tell me to do A, B, and C to get to here or there. Yet when
            I ask people <em>much&nbsp;</em>older than me for advice&mdash;and
