            >My Dearest Friend,<br />
            <br />
            As I was walking home with a bag of groceries tonight, with Ella
            Fitzgerald singing in my earpods, I thought about what I should
            write about in my next letter. So I got home, stashed my groceries
            away, sat down and opened TinyLetter, scrolled through the drafts,
            and found this one.<br />
            <br />
            It was marked as letter 32, but sometimes another topic or story
            becomes more vivid so I write about that other thing instead, and
            stow some letters away for another day. I read through this one
            again, and today felt like that other day. So here you go &mdash; a
            letter from the past, written early February 2023. Enjoy.<br />

            >January is the sibling that makes us late to walk out the door. She
            never rushes &ndash; January stretches lazily after she wakes,
            fumbles to the bathroom, and takes her precious time picking an
            outfit and tying her shoelaces. She ignores our frantic
            annoyance:&nbsp;<em
              >&quot;Hurry up!!&nbsp;We have to go!&quot;&nbsp;</em
            >Lounges on the couch and chews her breakfast slowly, while
            we&#39;re gathering our things, pacing the home, anxious for the day
            to begin.<br />
            <br />
            That&#39;s how long and arduous it felt. So much so that I
            repeatedly thought,
            <em>Oh my gosh, you&#39;re only a&nbsp;<u>month?</u></em
            ><br />
            <br />
            I am more used to the rush. When something like a new year or season
            dawns upon us, our minds become fretful because the uncertainty
            taunts us, the plans excite us, and everything else in-between seems
            so up to chance.<br />
            <br />
            So instead of subjecting myself to this kind of energy at the start
            of each new year, I am wondering if there is a better way.<br
              style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85)"
            />
            <br />
            I&#39;m writing this to you from a half-empty apartment. I have a
            mattress but no bed frame, a&nbsp;sofa but not yet assembled.
            I&#39;m sitting on a nice balcony chair, which I waddled &amp;
            carried across the lobby myself, and I have a well-stocked little
            bookshelf and a friend&#39;s drawing on my bedside table. A telling
            snapshot of what I consider as bare necessities?<br />
            <br />
            For the past month a few friends have asked me about my annual
            &quot;theme&quot; &ndash; one I always enjoy coming up with every
            year. From 2019-2022, my range of themes included:&nbsp;<em
              >Bravery, Apologising Less, Do &amp; See What Happens.</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            When I was writing&nbsp;<a href="29-happy-new-year.html"
              >my last letter to you</a
            >, I had a semblance of what this year&#39;s was, but not yet a word
            or phrase that felt fitting. My theme of the year felt more suitable
            manifested as a physical gesture, rather than a written phrase. And
            those gestures would be: holding a locket to your chest; drifting
            off to sleep; a self-hug; putting one hand on your chest, pressing
            gently, and taking&nbsp;<em>deeeeep&nbsp;</em>deep breaths.<br />
            <br />
            My theme of the year is comfort. It&#39;s ease. It&#39;s making
            myself into a home, a place where we switch off our survival mode
            &ndash; and we are safe, and&nbsp;<strong><em>kept</em></strong
            >, and loved, and worthy of a chance, no matter what happens.<br />
            <br />
            A theme isn&#39;t as straightforward as a resolution. I didn&#39;t
            have a&nbsp;step 1, step 2, step 3. Rather, they rely on constant
            reminders &ndash; so here are 3 of mine:<br />
            <br />
            <strong>1. To fight with myself less</strong><br />
            It&#39;s not easy to switch off survival mode. We are programmed to
            hustle and be productive and to always be&nbsp;<em>ahead</em>,
            whatever that means. Even my colour-coordinated Google Calendar,
            despite me being proud of it, can slowly but surely consume my life
            if I&#39;m not careful.<br />
            <br />
            But if success came from demanding more of myself, of seeing how
            close we can get to burnout &mdash; if that works as well as we
            think it would, then all of us would be swimming in college degrees
            and job offers and accolades. Instead, I&#39;m just sitting here in
            my lounge chair, watching the sky turn purple. (And it&#39;s
            beautiful, I&#39;m telling you!)<br />
            <br />
            At age 23, I&#39;m learning what it means to live at a more
            forgiving pace.

            There are podcasts and interviews and books ready to give me advice
            on navigating these changes, but my favourite has to be a tweet by
            Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, written on June 2020 at the height of
            COVID-19:<br />

            became clear that what saves us amidst adversity or change, is a
            constant. That constant can be a prayer, an act, a person.<br />
            <br />
            For me, it&#39;s the first few steps of a morning walk. The warm
            light on my exhaust fan, and the sizzling sounds of cooking dinner.
            It&#39;s that silent 1-2 minutes leaning on the kitchen counter,
            waiting for my kettle to boil.&nbsp;<span

              <br />
              When we are together, my friends and I easily slide into topics of
              psychology: our personalities, communication styles,
              relationships, habits. You can say we&#39;re a very safe,
              self-aware bunch (if not just weirdly addicted to psychoanalysing
              ourselves voluntarily.) But we prefer the term &quot;comfortable
              with each other&quot;!<br />
              <br />
              Anyway, one of the conversations we had a few weeks ago was around
              strengths and weaknesses. In a group of 4, each of us took turns
              in naming one weakness our friend had, followed by one strength. I
              wouldn&#39;t tell you what the group said was mine, of course, but
              I could tell you one of the major lessons I got from that
              conversation: to let people see you, and to let people in.<br />
              <br />
              There are two myths that have hindered this for me. First, up
              until recently, I used to think letting people in meant signing a
              pledge to share
              about&nbsp;<em>everything&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>.&nbsp;But
              Bren&eacute; Brown writes in her book that there is a difference
              between vulnerability and oversharing.</span
            ><br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I call it floodlighting,&quot; Bren&eacute; says. &quot;A lot
            of times we share too much information as a way to protect us from
            vulnerability. [...] Oversharing is not
            vulnerability.&nbsp;Vulnerability requires boundaries, and
            they&rsquo;re different for everyone.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t share
            anything where your self-worth or healing depends upon the reaction
            you get back.&quot; (Full interview

              I&#39;m glad I did. Part of applying that is to not share about,

              I used to do a lot, and instead of helping me heal, this would
              lead me to stress more, and worse, compromised my sense of safety

              and she asked, &quot;How have <em>you</em> been? Is everything

              asking. Just a lot of stressful stuff recently, but I&#39;ll
              probably tell you once I&#39;ve had time to process it myself. I
              don&#39;t feel ready to talk about it at all.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              She responded lovingly, &quot;Aw Jo, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m here
              if you want to talk about it. If you need anything at all!&quot;
              and I said, &quot;Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.&quot;
              And that was it. Which brings me to my second myth: That people
              don&#39;t care, or that we somehow become &quot;burdens&quot; by
              sharing.<br />
              <br />
              Each time, I&#39;ve always found the opposite to be proven true.
              Genuine friendships get strengthened by vulnerability, not
              threatened. In fact, as a friend, I&#39;d be more hurt if I knew
              my friend <em>refused&nbsp;</em>to let me be there for them,
              versus if they had come to me because they needed a listening ear
              (in which I&#39;d feel glad that they trusted me, and glad to
              offer anything, even if it were just minutes of my time.)<br />
              <br />
              So perhaps &mdash;&nbsp;<em>perhaps&nbsp;</em>&mdash;</span

              regardless. Those boundaries vary case by case, but comfort and
              ease happen when we insist less on fending for ourselves, on our
              own. Even primally, we are created and designed to need each
              other.<br />
