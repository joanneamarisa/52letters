              >My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              It was my last day of work yesterday. As excited as I am to start
              at a new workplace tomorrow, I am also mourning the loss of my old
              job&nbsp;today. And that&#39;s okay!<br />
              <br />
              Yesterday my office team surprised me with a bouquet of fresh
              flowers&nbsp;with a bag of goodies as a proper goodbye. One I
              absolutely did not expect and sent me home feeling so grateful.
              I&#39;m lucky to have left on such terms, and to come away from my
              (first) office job with good lessons&nbsp;and
              fond&nbsp;memories.<br />
              <br />
              <span
                style="

              >I don&#39;t know if &quot;mourning&quot; or &quot;grieving&quot;
              are the right words &mdash; they are tied to very devastating
              pictures of loss, like black veils and cries at a funeral. Whereas
              mine is captured in this batch of soft pink, green, and white
              flowers I have wrapped around my arms, remembering the smiles of
              my colleagues as<span

                >&nbsp;I wait for the (last ever) train to arrive.<br />
                <br />
                As I look ahead into the year (<em
                  >psshh.. whatever that means</em
                >),&nbsp;I&#39;ve lived long enough to know that losing is also
                part of the bargain. In letting go, we step into newness. So
                there has to be room for it amidst&nbsp;our ambitions to
                progress, to start new chapters or become new selves. Because
                you can&#39;t have growth without the losses.&nbsp;Instead,
                loss&nbsp;generously makes room for our hope.<br />
                <br />
                Someone walking into a marriage may think about losing their
                singleness. Someone moving to a new country may ruminate about
                what&nbsp;they&#39;re leaving behind. In my case &mdash; aside
                from my job &mdash; my housemate had dropped off the keys to our
                old apartment earlier this week.<br />
                <br />
                An apartment we spent about 2&ndash;3 years in. On its final
                day, I stepped in after the cleaners scrubbed the place up.
                There are no stains on the kitchen counter, and I think of those
                kimchi stir fries or beef soups we concocted at this very stove.
                All the gossip, the life updates we shared just by standing at 3
                opposite sides of the kitchen &mdash; one of us near the fridge,
                one at the doorway, and one at&nbsp;the snack cabinet &mdash;
                and we could easily spend 30 minutes on a weeknight&nbsp;just
                chatting right there.<br />
                <br />
                The carpets were steamed and spotless. The bedrooms were left
                empty, doors ajar, and I remember how at each doorway we would
                wish the other person a&nbsp;<em>good luck&nbsp;</em>&mdash; for
                an upcoming test, a job application, a visa extension. And
                we&#39;d complain about the noise, and the light bulbs that
                didn&#39;t work, and the cheap door locks, and the heat when
                it&#39;s summer time. But memories had seeped into the walls of
                that three-bedroom flat, and I tried my best to bring as much as
                I can with me, as I finally left and closed its door for the
                last time.<br />
                <br />
                Sometimes losses aren&#39;t as romantic &mdash; only sickening
                and devastating the moment they happen. But with the several
                that I&#39;ve had throughout my lifetime, given enough time,
                I&#39;m able to realise that they, too, were grace. Time gives
                meaning to loss &mdash; not
                necessarily&nbsp;<em>reason,&nbsp;</em>but just an assurance
                that it had to happen, to take us to where we are now.</span

                losses.&nbsp;Yet these jarring changes to my personal and
                professional life must only mean that better things are coming.
                In fact, I see them trickling in. It just takes a bit of hope, a
                bit of faith, to see them.<br />
