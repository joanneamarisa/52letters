                  stories about everyday moments that, to me, feel somewhat
                  miraculous. I might write to you about triumph or grief, life
                  and love, and other things you and I share that make us

              My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I am constantly barraged with thoughts of where I could flee at
              this very moment. This morning I stepped into a market to buy an
              iced coffee and thought,&nbsp;<em
                >I&#39;d love a&nbsp;ticket away</em
              >, as I passed the aisles of fresh produce.<br />
              <br />
              We&#39;re well into March which means it&#39;s a bit late to still
              be using terms like &quot;this new year&quot;, but&nbsp;<em
                >this new year,&nbsp;</em
              >I have been addicted to starting anew.<br />
              <br />
              In the span of a month between pre-Christmas to January, I had
              signed up for a dance class, pottery workshop, a 6-week barre
              intensive, and chopped my hair the shortest it&#39;s been. Smaller
              beginnings also ensued, such as buying new jeans or sipping my
              first espresso martini.<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s a whole &quot;now or never&quot; type of living now.<br />
              <br />
              You may share the same feeling; a craving to jet plane elsewhere,
              try a new hobby, or do something refreshingly uncharacteristic for
              you to do, as we dust off the debris from our seen or unseen
              battles over the last 2 years.<br />
              <br />
              What I&#39;m suggesting may sound like escapism, and it felt that
              way at first. However as time went by, they began to feel like the
              opposite.<br />
              <br />
              A couple weeks ago I walked into our dance studio and a woman sat
              next to me before class. Unpacking our things, I recognised her
              from the first time I joined &mdash; it had been her first time
              coming too. I introduced myself (after a long few minutes of
              mustering up the courage), at which point the woman, who came in
              with a quiet, sheepish smile, turned wide-eyed and excitedly
              introduced herself too. A minute later, we are raving about all
              the new shows in town &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Hamilton,</em>&nbsp;<em
                >Moulin Rouge</em
              >,&nbsp;<em>An American in Paris&nbsp;</em>&mdash; how she got
              tickets with her mother to see&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of them, and
              for a moment, in an exchange of &quot;I know right!&quot; and
              &quot;Oh my gosh same!&quot; we were just revelling in being
              alive, and being there.<br />
              <br />
              In remembering this I ponder,&nbsp;<em
                >Is trying the uncomfortable a form of escape? Or is it a way of
                making myself even more at home?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Home is another debate: Whether it&#39;s in Melbourne, in my
              hometown, or in Jakarta, I frankly don&#39;t know. You may be
              reading this from Tasmania, Texas, New York City (and who among us
              know?) But just now, as I write this to you, I land on a verdict:
              Home is wherever we feel the freedom and courage to become.<br />
              <br />
              My &quot;try everything&quot; conquest may sound like a manic
              quarter-life episode (not ruling that out yet). Escapist as it may
              sound, it&#39;s not to make me momentarily forget about life, but
              to solidify a sense of belonging in the life I already inhabit. I
              feel very at home with myself when I enter a class as an anonymous
              newcomer. Or when I leave a salon with freshly cut hair to the
              point of unrecognisable (yet I feel a little braver). I make
              conversation with the barista so I could love commuting to my
              9&ndash;5. I stare at the ceiling of my friends&#39; living room
              as we talk about our secrets, because when else will any of us be
              this young?<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;ve sat and walked and ran and stood in every nook and cranny
              Melbourne could offer me. Home is nowhere out here, but everywhere
              in the new memories that lullaby me to sleep. My friend&#39;s
              living room has been emptied and rented out. The stains of pottery
              clay on my shoes have disappeared. New adventures escape me as
              quick as they find me, you know? So I seek for new ones
              endlessly.<br />
              <br />
              To wrap this first letter I may leave you with this: Break the
              shell if it means you can swim through life more comfortable. Go
              against the grain of what you&#39;ve been telling yourself, and if
              you find it can make you feel excited about life again,
              wouldn&#39;t it be nice to see what happens then?<br />
