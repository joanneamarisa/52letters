              <br />
              <em>Happy spring.&nbsp;</em>I know that&#39;s not entirely
              accurate to say given that you&#39;re all sitting in different
              corners of the world, but I couldn&#39;t resist the
              call&nbsp;for&nbsp;new beginnings.<br />
              <br />
              One of the newsletters I subscribe to is written by a Product
              Designer named Budi Tanrim. In one of his
              <a
                href="https://newsletter.buditanrim.co/p/next-month-ill-quit-my-job"
                >letters</a
              >
              last month, he wrote: &quot;Next month, I&#39;ll quit my
              job.&quot;</span
            >
          </div>

          <div>
            <br />
            <span
              style="
                color: rgb(85, 85, 85);
                font-size: 16px;
                font-style: normal;
                font-weight: 400;
              "
              >He didn&#39;t quit &ndash; or at least, not that I&#39;m aware of
              &ndash; but he reflected that this was how he
              thought&nbsp;<em>about&nbsp;</em>his job. It&#39;s derived
              from&nbsp;<em>Bushido</em>, a Japanese&nbsp;moral code for Samurai
              that means, &quot;To&nbsp;keep death in mind.&quot; If a Samurai
              keeps death in mind and lived every day as if it were his last, it
              forces him to conduct his actions in the best way possible.<br />

                >Work like you&#39;re quitting.&nbsp;</em
              >Budi asks us the question: &quot;If you quit next month, do you
              feel you&#39;ve made enough impact? Are you working on things that
              truly matter to you?&quot;</span

              >Coincidentally, my mother turned on Netflix the other day to a
              movie called&nbsp;<em>All My Life&nbsp;</em>(starring Harry Shum,
              Jr.) I was sitting in the room, paying half attention when at the
              end, the monologue said:</span

          <blockquote>
            <div>

                >&quot;Everything can change in a day, in an instant. A full

                guaranteed.&quot;</span
              >
            </div>

              >I am not one to be impulsive &ndash; as much as I&#39;d
              <em>love&nbsp;</em>to be the&nbsp;main character who
              makes&nbsp;rash, whimsical&nbsp;decisions that lead to the
              happiest moments of her life. On the contrary, I&#39;m far more
              calculated, and far less brave. But I do agree:&nbsp;<em
                >Later is not guaranteed.</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              So adopting the principles above, I reflect on my own
              life:&nbsp;<em
                >If I were to leave Melbourne next month, what would I pocket
                with me?&nbsp;</em
              >I won&#39;t pretend like I&#39;ve never toyed with the idea
              (although that&#39;s a story for another letter.) I ask,&nbsp;<em
                >What would I have done or gained, and more importantly, what
                would I have given? To this city, and to the people it has
                brought me?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Facing this question stresses me out. The same way reflecting on
              &quot;what I have achieved / not achieved in my life&quot; pushes
              me well near an existential crisis. But in the wake of the past
              two years &ndash; of being cooped up and having everything you
              love&nbsp;be so...&nbsp;disposable... I realise this is how my
              brain is choosing to cope. By registering how vulnerable we all
              are to change.<br />
              <br />
              And so I need to live&nbsp;<em>as if&nbsp;</em>I&#39;m not going
              to have the same chances tomorrow as I do today. What have I been
              putting off?&nbsp;If Heaven dragged me by the wrists and up for
              the skies, what would make me want to go back and say, &quot;Not
              now!&quot;?<br />
              <br />
              I also realise, that to live &quot;as if&quot; is how we manage to
              survive.<br />
              <br />
              In those two years of the pandemic, we were living&nbsp;<em
                >as if&nbsp;</em
              >things were going to get better. Despite every logic, every
              headline saying the opposite, this blind hope was what kept us
              going. In moments where I&#39;m not seeing eye to eye with someone
              I love, I need to start seeing them&nbsp;<em>as if&nbsp;</em>I can
              lose them at any minute. Because &mdash; harsh truth &mdash; I
              can, and suddenly the questions&nbsp;no longer matter.<br />
              <br />
              This perspective, albeit wildly extreme, enables me to see big
              picture, especially when I feel
              <a href="18-on-navigating-stuckness.html"
                >stuck&nbsp;going through the motions</a
              >.<br />
              <br />
              I&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>live &quot;as if&quot;. I know I work a
              9-to-5 in marketing which is hardly curing cancer or saving the
              whales, I know. And I know that people could be running businesses
              out of their homes or taking the same train commuting
              each&nbsp;day, and also feel the same fear: A fear of
              insignificance.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              But as the life-saving saying goes, &quot;You gotta
              be&nbsp;delirious to stay motivated.&quot;
              I&#39;ve&nbsp;<em>gotta&nbsp;</em>live as if it is the most
              important work I&#39;ll ever find myself doing. I&#39;m not aiming
              for a <em>significant </em>life. I&#39;m aiming for a life fully
              lived.<br />
              <br />
              It helps to pull out your safety net of &#39;tomorrow&#39; from
              time to time. I think each of us owes it to our dreams to meet
              them <em>as soon as we are able to</em>. Each of us
              has&nbsp;<em>got&nbsp;</em>to live as if what we are doing or
              creating or putting out into the world is life or death. Is now or
              never. Because&nbsp;otherwise, what reason do we have to keep
              going?</span
