                A friend asked me towards the end of last year, &quot;What&#39;s
                one lesson that you learned this year that you think is worth
                sharing?&quot;<br />
                <br />

                <em>all</em> our rejection letters, in all their heart-wrenching
                glory. (Anyone in?)<br />
                <br />
                My question wasn&#39;t around why, but how<em>.&nbsp;</em>When
                my doubtful inner critic&nbsp;questioned, &quot;<em
                  >Have I become lazy? Is it because I didn&#39;t try hard
                  enough?&quot;&nbsp;</em

                  >Straight-A lifelong people-pleaser like you? Never!&quot;</em
                ><br />
                <br />
                So what was it?<br />
                <br />
                I realised it&#39;s because when that first &quot;no&quot; came
                in, I survived it. And then I realised,&nbsp;<em
                  >Oh. We&nbsp;do survive failure</em
                >.<br />
                <br />
                From then,&nbsp;I became somewhat &quot;addicted&quot;&nbsp;to
                trying. Without fear of what the outcome would do to you, it
                enables you to keep going, applying, asking, trying, with full
                stubborn belief that you&nbsp;could do it.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                Honestly, it&#39;s almost like playing dumb. These days, I
                don&#39;t give&nbsp;my imposter syndrome time to fully form, and
                pay very little attention to my inner critic&#39;s theories.
                Both I do on purpose. What we think about ourselves is
                interesting information, but isn&#39;t always true.<br />
                <br />
                I&#39;m more drawn to the miraculous, transformative thing that
                happens&nbsp;when my priority is always to give&nbsp;myself a
                chance:&nbsp;I&#39;m less fixated on result. Less ashamed if I
                don&#39;t win.&nbsp;</span

                >Here&#39;s the thing: We know that in every person&#39;s life,
                no matter how generous&nbsp;and kind-hearted they are, everyone
                has the people they are most to least closest to. We have
                varying levels of trust, shared interest, time spent &mdash;
                it&#39;s only natural, and even healthy.<br />
                <br />
                But&nbsp;our problem is, we become adults, and our interpersonal
                relationships become more&nbsp;calculated and self-critical. We
                worry about&nbsp;<em>where&nbsp;</em>we fall within these ranks.
                <em>Are we close that way?</em

                  out?&nbsp;Am I being too much?&nbsp;</em
                >Pair that with the fear of &quot;showing all our cards too
                soon&quot;, and we construct a habit &amp; culture of keeping
                each other at arm&#39;s length.<br />
                <br />
                I realised&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t the only one feeling this way about
                navigating adult friend/relationships. Earlier last week, my
                friend and I sat on the front steps of our other friend&#39;s
                apartment. And we both spoke about how massive our circles felt
                in university, and how it has dwindled naturally over time.<br />
                <br />
                In contrary to school&nbsp;when timelines were linear and
                everyone was friends by proximity, adult relationships come and
                go, making it hard to discern where we sit on other people&#39;s
                &quot;scales&quot;. But I&#39;m tired of living on eggshells
                &ndash; of second guessing my friendships.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                Especially the ones where I <em>know&nbsp;</em>they bring good
                value to my life,&nbsp;I <em>know</em>&nbsp;they want to see me
                happy and okay, and I <em>know&nbsp;</em>they&#39;re
                friends&nbsp;with whom&nbsp;I can be honest and clear with,
                including about boundaries.<br />
                <br />
                People agreeing to be a part of your life, and allowing
                you&nbsp;to be a part of theirs,&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>the
                gift.&nbsp;What if we embrace,
                even&nbsp;<em>assume&nbsp;</em>mutual love and care,
                without&nbsp;worrying about how much or how little those
