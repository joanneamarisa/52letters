              <br />
              Good morning. I fell asleep in the living room, and as I
              woke,&nbsp;a strip of morning light was on the wall opposite of
              me. I had forgotten how much I loved mornings. I looked out past
              the balcony and caught a glimpse of sunrise, and it gave me a
              sliver of hope again after a dark night.<br />

              <em>are</em> behind schedule, as &quot;52&quot; was intended to
              fulfil each week of the year. But we will forgive ourselves and
              make do. There&#39;s been a lot of&nbsp;that this year.<br />
