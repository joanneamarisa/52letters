                  I</em
                >nstead of mom, she&rsquo;s going to call me Point B,<br />
                because that way she knows that no matter what happens, she can
                always find her way to me.<br />
                <br />
                I am going to paint the Solar Systems on the backs of her hands,
                so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say
                &lsquo;Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.&rsquo;<br />
                <br />
                And she&rsquo;s going to learn that this life will hit you,
                hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up&nbsp;just so it
                can kick you in the stomach,<br />
                but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to
                remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air.<br />
                <br />
                There&#39;ll be days like this,&nbsp;when you open your hands to
                catch, and wind up with only blisters and bruises. When your
                boots will fill with rain and you&rsquo;ll be up to your knees
                in disappointment.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say
                thank you.<br />
                <br />
                You will put the <u>wind</u> in win some &hellip; lose some,<br />
                you will put the <u>star</u> in starting over and over.<br />
                And no matter how many landmines erupt in a minute, be sure your
                mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.<br />
                <br />
                And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn
                naive.<br />
                <br />
                But I want her to know that this world is made of sugar. It can
                crumble so easily, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to stick your
                tongue out and taste it.<br />
                Remember that good things come in threes, and so do bad
                things,<br />
                and always apologise when you&rsquo;ve done something
                wrong,&nbsp;but don&rsquo;t you ever apologise for the way your
                eyes refuse to stop shining.<br />
                <br />
                And when they finally hand you a heartache,<br />
                when they slip war and hatred under your door<br />
                and offer you handouts on street corners, of cynicism and
                defeat,<br />
                you tell them that they<br />
                really ought to meet your mother.&quot;</span

              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;ve always loved that poem. This morning, I sat at my desk
              and
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE&ab_channel=TED"
                >played it back</a
              >&nbsp;again. I listen to it at least once every year.<br />
              <br />
              Recently, my mother took me on her jogging route. We were passing
              lakes,&nbsp;quiet streets, and quieter neighbourhoods before the
              sun fully shone.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              When the morning light came, it was the colour of citrus. If
              houses were people, I imagined that each one was stretching its
              arms, rising lazily from its slumber. Opening its front&nbsp;doors
              &mdash; a yawn&nbsp;&mdash; and drawing the curtains of its
              windows &mdash; a pair of eyes,&nbsp;batting awake.<br />
              <br />
              As the morning grew busier, I thought about Sarah&#39;s poem;
              about resilience, how life is both beautiful and brutal, and about
              how resilience finds us. Resilience happens when, as is often the
              case, the world doesn&#39;t follow the scripts we write for
              it.&nbsp;It&#39;s about not getting what you wanted. About
              heartache. About things unraveling the way you didn&#39;t expect
              it to.<br />
              <br />
              In&nbsp;the words of Sarah Kay, this hits you hard, &quot;in the
              face, waits for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the
              stomach.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s funny because two thoughts occurred to me:</span
