              <br />
              I think we all have different hiding places. You may expect me to
              say something like a cigarette or a bottle, but there are far less
              nuanced, more convenient hiding places. Last Thursday, I was
              sitting in a pitch meeting led by a man, who must&#39;ve been in
              his mid-40s. At the beginning of his pitch, he&nbsp;started
              using&nbsp;media jargon such as CRM or LPV or something. I forgot
              which topic it was, but before he moved on, he paused his
              pitch&nbsp;and said,</span

            It was refreshing. Like&nbsp;he&#39;d peeled back a layer to say,
            <em>Don&#39;t mind me. Just somewhat hiding.&nbsp;</em>Because who
            doesn&#39;t feel important and special when sitting in a&nbsp;board
            room? With one of those long shiny meeting tables and maybe a fancy
            little laser pointer?<br />
            <br />
            There I realised, rooms like these can be hiding places too. So can
            big, important words. Hiding places are what we run to when a part
            of us feels undone; often, it is a version of ourselves that we
            consider more &#39;acceptable&#39;.&nbsp;<span

            <br />
            But if Quasimodo had never left his bell tower, how would he have
            realised that he was, in fact, lovable?

            <br />
            In about 5 weeks, I will be traveling home to see my family.
            Thoughts around hiding-vs-showing-up, I often equate to my feelings
            around returning to those dynamics. In a melting pot of giddiness
            and bubbling excitement, there are nerves and butterflies in my
            chest, which is silly to say about seeing&nbsp;the people who
            watched me grow up.<br />
            <br />
            And yet. I lay awake at 1AM and think,&nbsp;<em
              >Have I done enough?</em
            >&nbsp;<em>Would they consider me enough?&nbsp;</em><br />
            <br />
            These thoughts are (1) unnecessary, because I should know better
            than to seek others&#39; approval for my self worth, and (2)
            uncharacteristic of the person I&#39;ve become. I&#39;m not one to
            criticise my life choices anymore, and in the past year I&#39;ve
            grown to be big-sisterly-protective over said choices, and my own
            needs and&nbsp;boundaries.<br />
            <br />
            And yet. I am wondering, like I used to when I was 16, about how
            I&#39;d pass to parents and friends and parents of friends and
            friends of parents.<em
              >&nbsp;Would I be proud? Would they be proud?</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            Why? My theory is that at the crux of discomfort, we search for
            somewhere to hide. We search for accolades or answers or costumes of
            selves that can make others or ourselves more comfortable.
            Discomfort can be internal: Avoidance of certain emotions or not
            wanting to answer necessary questions; or external:&nbsp;An
            important-and-special meeting room; a first, second date; making
            friends in a new environment. Understandably we hide when we evade
            being&nbsp;<em>truly&nbsp;</em>seen for who we are, which, if
            that&#39;s ever rejected, would be gravely more devastating.<br />
            <br />
            But being seen is how we recognise that we are worthy of love and
            belonging, <em>as we truly are</em>. You&#39;re right, being seen
            also risks awkward conversations or people seeing you laugh a little
            too loud or people actually&nbsp;<em>knowing&nbsp;</em>you, at which
            point we cannot predict their acceptance. But could it be that our
            habit of hiding is why we stay in places not meant for us, for too
            long?<br />
            <br />
            So how do we unlearn the instinct to hide?&nbsp;Well, dear friend,
            I&#39;m in the midst of learning that&nbsp;(I have around 5 weeks
            left to learn it, to be exact), but here are a couple I can share
            with you:<br />
            <br />
            <strong
              >I try my best to surround myself with people I never feel the
              need to hide from</strong
            >. I think it&#39;s important to be around people who make you feel
            like two things: Like you want to be the best version of yourself,
            and like you&nbsp;<em>already are&nbsp;</em>the best version of
            yourself, simultaneously.<br />
            <br />
            They make you want to be better, not as a bid to alter yourself for
            their approval, but because they <em>already</em>&nbsp;see you, and
            believe in you, and that they will continue to see and love you,
            whoever you become.<br />
            <br />
            (Bonus tip: I don&#39;t know about you, but I feel the most seen
            when I laugh. So maybe if you&#39;re trying to find those names,
            seek out the people in your life who can make you laugh.)<br />
            <br />
            <strong>&#39;Bad art&#39; it out.</strong> This is more about
            addressing that discomfort &mdash; whatever you&#39;re dreading or
            anticipating or even confused about. Journal it out, but please,
            write badly. Yes, I forbid you to write a sonnet! If it&#39;s music,
            then don&#39;t even try to sing that well! Create as uncomfortably
            as how you feel and worry less about its outcome &mdash; this is a
            practice in showing up in the world as you are, less fixated on how
            you appear.<br />
            <br />
            We are all one and the same, with our own vulnerabilities and
            Achilles heels and our own fears of the future and those handful of
            people we try hard to impress. So in sitting down with your
            discomfort, rest in the comfort that your troubles are less unique
            than you think.<br />
            <br />
            Learning to neutrally sit with messier parts of our humanness helps
            us diffuse the intensity of these emotions, and give them a space to
            be held. And really all they need is to be held.<br />
            <br />
            One of the most endearing things I remember about Quasimodo is when
            he finally emerged into the light, and joined the people of Paris as
            one of their own, kids loved him. They try and climb up his
            shoulders, and the townspeople knew his name.<br />
