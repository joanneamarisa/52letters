              >My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Oh, goodness. We are halfway through&nbsp;<em
                >52 Letters from Jo</em
              >! How thrilling!<br />
              <br />
              I found it exciting that this trail of postcards
              could&nbsp;capture a year of our lives. Who was I in
              <a href="hello-home-starting-anew-1.html"
                >the first letter I wrote</a
              >? Who would I be in Letter 52?<br />
              <br />
              This journey can only be bookended by two (potentially, and
              hopefully) different versions of us, if you think about it. One
              that&#39;s behind us and one that&#39;s a more mysterious
              amalgamation of ourselves, between now &#39;til however long it
              takes to get to Letter 52. Isn&#39;t that exciting and
              nerve-wracking at the same time?<br />
              <br />
              Anyway, writing a letter to you each week has brought me great
              joy. Whoever you are, in whatever capacity&nbsp;you receive or
              enjoy them,&nbsp;I wanted to say thank you for being here.<br />
              <br />
              I thought I&#39;d mark this little milestone by sharing&nbsp;<em
                >how</em
              >
              this letter found you.
              <em>What happened to the blog?&nbsp;</em>some of you have asked.
              Why letters now?&nbsp;And why am I writing at all?<br />

                determined to finish university.</span

              (Towards the end of it, she did :))<br />
              <br />
              For 5-6 years the blog&nbsp;was like soil for writing practice,
              until I finally deactivated and brought the chapter to a close
              around the time I was turning 22.<br />
              <br />
              One of my reasons for stopping was actually simple in that I
              started to feel an illusive pressure to perform. When every piece
              of craft is a performance, it&#39;s only a matter of time until we
              feel stage fright.<span

                >&nbsp;I realised my fear&nbsp;had little to do with readership
                and more to do with my relation</span
              >&nbsp;to writing that needed deeper addressing:&nbsp;<em

              ><br />
              <br />
              So I decided, that even though I love reading other people&#39;s
              blogs (up to this day), I personally had to let go of what was no
              longer&nbsp;a healthy medium.&nbsp;<br />

                >And then the pandemic happened. During that time, I was
                inspired by one of my friends who posted a photo of a
                letter&nbsp;she got from her pen pal.<br />
                <br />
                <em>What?&nbsp;</em>I remember asking.&nbsp;<em
                  >You have pen pals?? People still have pen pals??<br />
                  <br />
                  Yes!&nbsp;</em
                >she replied excitedly. She explained to me that her pen pal
                lived quite far from her. And here I was thinking it was a lost
                art!<br />
                <br />
                And that&#39;s how I &ndash; spontaneously,
                but&nbsp;intentionally &ndash; asked 3-4 of my closest friends
                to see if they would like to be my pen pals. In the first few
                months of lockdown, it was their&nbsp;postcards and handwritten
                notes, both the receiving of and replying to them, that tethered
                my existence.<br />
                <br />
                I think the magic that happens in letter-writing is it brings us
                back to the sacredness of expression. My one and only writing
                advice I ever give to people is to be vulnerable, and that&#39;s
                more possible to do when writing to a friend, as opposed to a
                sea of persons.<br />
                <br />
                I liked the neatness of it, too &ndash; when I write my thoughts
                onto a piece of paper, sometimes paired with little doodles of
                the view from my window or a local bakery&#39;s pastry of the
                day, and send it away to my friend in an envelope, a part of me
                becomes safely theirs. Parts of them are safely mine.<br />
                <br />
                One of my friends would mark hers with copious amounts
                of&nbsp;washi tape. Another would send me so many pages she had
                to number each side of paper. In isolation, we sought out
                connection, and found it in the simplest way of words. Not
                profound words, just honest words &ndash; of how we were feeling
                or what we were thinking of that day.<br />
                <br />
                And it was in that one-bedroom apartment, penning letters to my
                friends, that I realised how much
                letter-writing&nbsp;encapsulates the reason I write at
                all.</span

                Clich&eacute; as it may sound, I

                <br />
                I think we all feel bad about&nbsp;<em>needing</em> other
                people. Yet I think all of us love feeling needed.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                I think we say sorry for &quot;saying too much&quot; or
                &quot;unloading too many stories&quot;. Yet&nbsp;I think all of
                us would jump at the opportunity to sit on a couch for hours,
                listening to our best friend&#39;s stories.</span

              This, among many other things, doesn&#39;t make us incongruent or
              frauds. It&#39;s just&nbsp;one of the things that makes us human.
              When we open ourselves up to each other&#39;s experiences, we
              learn that the things we like or don&#39;t like about
              ourselves&nbsp;threads us together with others, more than it makes
              us unique. Because uniqueness can be a lonely experience.<br />
              <br />
              When really: We all forget to water our plants and we&#39;ve all
              said things we don&rsquo;t mean. We all know the feeling of clammy
              hands and utter devastation and the thrilling euphoria of when we
              are mid-laughter. We all feel love and strain with parents or
              lovers. We all pair our fear of the future with a hope that tastes
              like delusion.<br />
