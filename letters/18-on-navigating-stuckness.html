              >Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              A few weeks ago, I remember feeling...&nbsp;<em>stuck</em>. Not in
              the literal sense, but in the sense that life likes to take its
              time, while my mind wants to go at full speed ahead.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Life unfolds at its own pace, as we&#39;re all aware, whereas we
              as humans are programmed to desire, living in a culture that tells
              us there&#39;s always more that we can have or become. This tug of
              war brings about an anxious restlessness in many &mdash; including
              myself &mdash; where we feel we&#39;re doing too much but not
              enough. More familiarly, this would sound something like:&nbsp;<em
                >I should be ______ by now.</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              When I feel stuck, there is usually an urge to numb out, to look
              at what other people are doing, to
              <a href="out-of-hiding.html">hide</a>... So instead, three things
              I am willing to practice in this coming month:<br />
              <br />
              <u>Paying closer attention.</u><br />
              <br />
              I normally want to disengage in seasons of stuckness, which are
              really seasons of discomfort and maybe boredom. But it is
              precisely&nbsp;<em>in </em>feelings of stuckness that indicate I
              need to be paying closer attention.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              When I feel stuck at my job, for instance, it&#39;s easy to
              disengage and spend months&nbsp;just going through the motions.
              (It&#39;s very easy to spend&nbsp;<em>a lot&nbsp;</em>of time
              going through the motions!) The flaw</span
            ><span
              style="
                color: rgb(85, 85, 85);
                font-size: 16px;
                font-style: normal;
                font-weight: 400;
              "
              >&nbsp;is it makes us lose sight of where we are.<br />
              <br />
              You feel stuck because you&#39;re dissatisfied, dissatisfaction
              leads to disengagement, disengaging leads to being less present
              and when&nbsp;you&#39;re not present, you picture a different life
              where you are seemingly more &quot;ahead&quot;. Nothing wrong with
              it of course, but when you constantly want it and draw comparisons
              with your present life, you feel stuck, and on goes the cycle.<br />
              <br />
              So to counter it, I
              pay&nbsp;<em>closer&nbsp;</em>attention.&nbsp;I try to think of
              building better habits on my commute, try to actually turn my
              chair and join conversations at work I normally would&#39;ve opted
              out of, try to listen more intently and really drive my ego to the
              ground to figure out what skills or traits I lack. Rediscovering
              is a remedy to stuckness, and most of the time &mdash; once I let
              go of the pride that says &quot;I&#39;ve seen it all&quot; &mdash;
              I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by what I find.</span

                >this is all I&#39;m getting. This is as good as it&#39;ll get.
                There&#39;s no way I can break out of this. They won&#39;t
                accept me. I won&#39;t be able to get to where I want. My
                circumstances make my aspirations impossible.</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              In self help books, this is called the &#39;fixed mindset&#39;.
              They are limiting beliefs that you are where you are because
              it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; to progress. This is something
              I&#39;ve been trying to divorce from within myself, too, which is
              done by <em>seriously&nbsp;</em>reassessing the stories I tell
              myself.<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s important to distance our identity and self worth from
              the seasons we&#39;re in. If I were to identify with my failures,
              for example, I&#39;d have a very hard time&nbsp;</span

              <br />
              My first ever therapist said to me once: &quot;You seem to have
              the urge to want to &#39;leap&#39; to this&nbsp;better place from
              where you are now. It&#39;s admirable, however the real changes
              only happen once you are&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal"
                >okay with where you are. Being okay with yourself
                comes&nbsp;</em
              >first.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Being okay with yourself comes first.<br />
              <br />
              However way you&#39;re feeling or whichever constraint you feel
              stuck&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal">in</em>&nbsp;(be it a
              job or an identity or a relationship status), I think
              it&#39;s&nbsp;important to take escapism out of the equation.
              It&nbsp;is<em>&nbsp;</em>true that being dissatisfied is often a
              catalyst that drives people into action (including good action!)
              But until we address the arbitrary metrics we use to measure our
              own success or progress in life, then stuckness &amp;
              dissatisfaction will follow us wherever we go.<br />
              <br />
              Something I say to God when I find myself desiring for something
              (too) strongly is, &quot;God, help me trust, and teach&nbsp;me to
              steward the soil.&quot; It basically means: Don&#39;t put me
              anywhere else if I&#39;m not stewarding, or taking care of, my
              own&nbsp;&#39;soil&#39;. David tended to sheep. What is my soil?
              What have I been given? How much? Am I handling it well?<br />
              <br />
              The question shouldn&#39;t be:
              <em>God, where can you take me? </em>The bigger question should
              be:
              <em
                >From where I&#39;m standing now, am I yielding good, lasting
                harvest?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              There are always people to love, habits to build, limiting beliefs
              to shed, and dreams to gracefully and patiently&nbsp;work towards.
              I believe none&nbsp;of us are ever as stuck &mdash; not at 21, not
              at 53 &mdash; as we are in need of the reminder to pay deeper
              attention, learn to make peace with where we are, and solidify (or
              broaden) our understanding of ourselves.<br />
