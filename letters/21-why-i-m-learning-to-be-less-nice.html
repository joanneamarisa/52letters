              <br />
              When you&#39;re in your 20s, a question you come across time and
              time again is:&nbsp;<em
                >Where do you see yourself in the next 5-10 years?&nbsp;</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              I come across this question a few times a year. But as I navigate
              work life and pay bills and do this sing-and-dance of
              &#39;gradulthood&#39;, I realise the question
              I&nbsp;<em>actually&nbsp;</em>feel confronted with every day
              is:&nbsp;<em>Who do I want to be in the next 5-10 years?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s not as cliche as it sounds. I think of this question more
              practically: H<span

              <em>So 5 years from now, who would I like to be?</em>&nbsp;To

              I&#39;m not talking about celebrities, influencers, or figures
              that you see two-dimensionally. I think it&#39;s important to have
              a list of people you admire, highly respect, and can learn from
              &mdash; and ideally, they are people you know. People whose
              struggles, wins, and characters you can see the ins and outs of,
              rather than people whose lives you scroll through.<br />
              <br />
              I have a handful that come to mind (mostly mentors, educators,
              leaders I&#39;ve had the honour of working with.) I try to pull a
              red thread on what they all share in common. I found three traits
              worth noting. Some food for thought?<br />

              ><strong>1. They are constant learners.</strong><br />
              <br />
              I&#39;m talking...&nbsp;<em>constant</em>. You know that feeling
              when you&#39;re speaking with someone and you think,
              <em>Wow, I can learn so much from this person</em>? Well, there
              are people who just&nbsp;<em>radiate&nbsp;</em>that, and I&#39;ve
              always been intrigued by how.<br />
              <br />
              I realise this is because they themselves are constant learners.
              My manager, for instance, often chirps about, &quot;Oh, I read an
              article the other day-&quot; or &quot;Oh, I taught myself how to
              do that! Took me weeks, but I finally got to it.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              This inspires me because it means that even though some of them
              are academics and/or have years of experience under their belt, no
              one on this list seems to see themselves as &#39;having
              arrived&#39;. They constantly expand and deepen said knowledge in
              the humility that there&#39;s always more to uncover, and this is
              why passing on or exuding that knowledge is something that comes
              so naturally to them.<br />
              <br />
              <u>Food for thought:</u> Am I still learning in my spare time?
              Does having a degree and a job make me complacent in my
              learning?<br />
              <br />
              <strong
                >2. They don&#39;t worry about being &quot;nice&quot;</strong
              ><br />
              <br />
              They are some of the most generous and kindest people I know. But
              &mdash; and maybe because they are mentors, managers, lecturers
              &mdash; they aren&#39;t frivolous with their time. In fact, they
              seem to safeguard their time and energy quite well. In doing so,
              they make sure they are at their most useful when people need
              them.&nbsp;<span
