              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Between wrapping up my final weeks at my workplace, scheduling
              movers for an apartment, taking our cat to the vet, and navigating
              the Facebook Marketplace dungeon of used furniture and erratic
              buyers,&nbsp;you can say I&#39;m a little stressed, haha.<br />
              <br />
              Today&nbsp;I buckled. After waiting all morning for movers that
              never came (a long story that I don&#39;t feel like
              reliving),&nbsp;I finally went home and was ready to
              just...&nbsp;<em>give up&nbsp;</em>on the day.<br />
              <br />
              Living in a foreign country is like this:&nbsp;on good days,
              it&#39;s beautiful. On hard days,
              it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>hard.<br />
              <br />
              So there I was, at the doorstep of my apartment, rummaging for
              keys when, from the inside, the&nbsp;man who is one of the
              cleaners of our building peered at me through the glass doors. He
              is a short-haired man, probably&nbsp;in his 30s, who doesn&#39;t
              say much&nbsp;except when we exchange&nbsp;<span

                >polite nods of &quot;hello&quot;s each time we pass each other
                on my floor.<br />
                <br />
                Every Friday I see him vacuuming,&nbsp;head down, earbuds
                in.&nbsp;</span
              >That moment, he recognised me and opened the access for me from
              the inside. And in&nbsp;I went with one of my boxes of clothes
              (and probably sweat on the side of my face).<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Thank you so much,&quot; I said, and he returned a smile.<br />
              <br />
              Next, I went to the lobby to see the building manager, having to
              tell her I&#39;m rescheduling the move.&nbsp;<span

              she mentioned.<br />
              <br />
              I told her the person with the next bookingcan start earlier and
              take over, if they&#39;d like.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Oh that&#39;s very kind,&quot; she replied, smiling
              sympathetically. &quot;I&#39;ll let them know, that&#39;s very
              kind.&quot;<br />

              continued,&nbsp;&quot;Did you have a parcel waiting?&quot; There
              was a row of parcels&nbsp;on her shelves.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;No, I think I&#39;m good!&quot; I said. She smiled, we
              thanked each other, I left.<br />
              <br />
              I&nbsp;walked to the elevator, the doors closed, and I shed a
              tear.<br />

              On good days, it&#39;s beautiful. On hard days,
              it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>hard.<br />
              <br />
              And on those hard days, a stranger opening the door or a lady who
              lends a listening ear, tremendously helps.&nbsp;It&#39;s only
              kindness that helps us navigate the overwhelm.</span

              >Kindness is the most distinct thing I remember from&nbsp;my first
              arrival to Melbourne.<br />
              <br />
              I was 18, and I took that first &quot;big move&quot; flight alone.
              Even though I know my way around airports,&nbsp;I don&#39;t
              remember it being as aesthetic as those montages you see on
              Instagram Reels. Majority of the time, I walked with mixed
              feelings, semi-afraid, hiding my puffy eyes after saying goodbyes
              to the family.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              In my phone case, I kept a folded up post-it note with a
              handwritten step-by-step on what to do after landing, and what
              numbers to call.&nbsp;<em>You got this, you got this, </em>I kept
              thinking to myself.<br />
              <br />
              But what really lit the path, was the kindness of strangers. One
              stranger, actually.&nbsp;We&#39;ll call her Diane.<br />
              <br />
              We got Diane&#39;s number from a family friend, and it was written
              onto my&nbsp;post-it note. She lives near the airport, and was
              meant to drive me to the city. When her&nbsp;minivan pulled up, I
              was greeted by a sprightly lady with curly hair, a
              rainbow-coloured top, jean&nbsp;shorts, and sunglasses. She
              opened&nbsp;the car door.<br />
              <br />
              &quot;Hello! Good morning!&quot; We introduced ourselves to each
              other and drove away. Because it was too early to collect the
              keys, Diane invited me to her house instead. And that&#39;s how I
              found myself in her kitchen at 8 in the morning, in a suburban
              family home that was just as comforting and messy as any.<br />
              <br />
              It was summer, and sunlight was coming in from every direction.
              There was a long wooden shelf on the left wall of the kitchen, and
              Diane&nbsp;toured me through her travel trinkets, her&nbsp;family
              photos, greeting cards from her church. She cooked me breakfast,
              asked &quot;Do you like to cook?&quot;, and proceeded to pull open
              a drawer full of every spice imaginable.<br />
              <br />
              As with any home, there were half-eaten, rubber-banded snacks on
              the counter. A multi-coloured pile of&nbsp;jackets on the coat
              stand. Board&nbsp;games and remote controls strewn across the
              sofas.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              And the mess welcomed me.&nbsp;The smell of eggs and bacon filled
              the air, interlaced with Diane&#39;s many stories.
              &quot;You&#39;ll like&nbsp;Melbourne!&quot; she said. Her beagle
              was following me the whole time, and I remember how the kitchen
              island glowed that morning.&nbsp;After the cold, isolating
              experience I had in the 12 hours leading up to it,&nbsp;it was the
              warmest I&#39;ve ever felt.</span

              >kindness. Last month, I was meeting up with her for dinner, and
              we agreed to meet at a park near the train station.<br />
              <br />
              I am right in saying it&#39;s been a stressful year. So as I was
              waiting for her, I was sitting on a bench, closing my eyes and
              holding my jacket close to my chest. I was lost in thought about
              recent events in my personal life, and for 5 minutes, I just let
              myself&nbsp;<em style="font-size: 16px">feel </em>all of it. In my
              mind, I&nbsp;walked slowly through the overwhelm. Not to pick it
              apart or logic my way into fixing it. Just to let myself be.</span

              >And then her message came. From a distance, I saw her smile, and
              rush to me from across the street. I waved back from where I was
              sitting, my train of thought disrupted instantly. As she reached
              the park, she was still smiling, and before we hugged, she was
              jumping up and down to see me.&nbsp;It has only been 4 weeks.<br />
              <br />
              Between you and me, dear reader, I can&#39;t tell you how healing
              that was. But it is.<br />
              <br />
              I didn&#39;t tell her. But I hope she knows. I hope they all
              do.</span
