                >On September 19th 1945, there was an incident&nbsp;on the
                rooftop of Hotel Yamato. A ripping sound, onlookers testified.
                Two young men had teared the blue stripe off the Netherlands
                flag &mdash; angrily, and rightfully so.<br />
                <br />
                By that time, our land was free, making the Dutch flag illegal
                (and wildly offensive) to hoist. As that stripe of blue falls to
                the ground, I&#39;d like us to consider how that freedom
                happened.<br />
                <br />
                On&nbsp;August 16th, a month prior, four other young men woke
                up&nbsp;at 4 in the morning&nbsp;with a plan. To&nbsp;kidnap the
                nation&#39;s&nbsp;leaders to force them to sign a document that
                declares this country ours.&nbsp;A rebellious tale, although
                many of the stories that fill our history textbooks are. So
                early before the sun even shone, they went to a secluded house
                in Western&nbsp;Java.<br />
                <br />
                Photos show them lounging on rattan armchairs, porcelain cups
                sitting on the coffee table. At a glance it would have seemed
                normal, like a family get-together, with frames on walls and
                flowers in the foyer. But history would tell us, they&nbsp;were
                making a case for freedom. Japan had just surrendered in the
                Pacific War. The officials hesitated, but the&nbsp;young people
                didn&#39;t want to wait any longer.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                <em>Freedom now or freedom never,</em>&nbsp;they
                argued,&nbsp;<em
                  >if we don&#39;t seize it now, we fall back into
                  their&nbsp;hands.&nbsp;</em
                ><br />
                <br />
                They were right. Because&nbsp;a month later, the Dutch and
                Japanese returned to claim a power that was no longer theirs.
                Which brings us back to the ripped flag on the rooftop of Hotel
                Yamato that hot September day. And to the wars and street fights
                that later ensued.</span

                >). When you&#39;re Indonesian, the story of independence
                entwines with everything you love, whether you&nbsp;like it or
                not.<br />
                <br />
                That story is about a land that continues to give, even after
                centuries of injustice. How generous of her, to be granting us
                new trees after&nbsp;giving in for hundreds of years to the
                footsteps of the Dutch.<br />
                <br />
                It&#39;s about my grandmother&#39;s cooking, my mother&#39;s
                smile, my grandfather&#39;s wind chimes &mdash; how a
                hasty&nbsp;independence paved the way for freedom to be ours,
                too.<br />
                <br />
                And it&#39;s about the youths, who fought for freedom in the
                first place, because what is being young if not
                seizing&nbsp;what the world is unwilling to hand us?</span
