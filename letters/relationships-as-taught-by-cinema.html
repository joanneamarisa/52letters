              I&#39;ve been waking up to the sound of roosters again, and it
              reminds me of the camping trips I used to go to growing up. The
              green is lush, the grass is always a little damp.&nbsp;I&#39;m
              surrounded by palm trees, and each time I stare at&nbsp;lapping
              waves I am left in a daze.&nbsp;</span

              Being back in the presence of family, now that I&#39;m

              In an animated film called&nbsp;<em
                >The Mitchells vs The Machines (2021)</em
              >, there is a teenage protagonist
              Riley&nbsp;who&nbsp;struggles&nbsp;to see eye-to-eye with her
              dad:&nbsp;a textbook overly protective father. He doesn&#39;t
              understand her&nbsp;ambitions, she feels he doesn&#39;t care, they
              both fail to communicate, and the rest will sound
              familiar.&nbsp;(They&#39;re also fighting the robot apocalypse
              here, but that&#39;s obviously less important.)<br />

              Whether you live on opposite ends of the world or sitting next to
              each other on the dining table, I realise&nbsp;being an adult is
              about being confronted with the need to build a bridge in order to
              understand your loved ones. I may move away and find that my loved
              ones carry different ideals or views of the world&nbsp;than the
              ones I formed on my own, away&nbsp;from them. What must one do
              then?<br />
              <br />
              Jonathan of <em>Cinema Therapy&nbsp;</em>brings an excellent point
              in relation to this: In conflict or disagreement,&nbsp;when we
              don&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, we start to wring
              ourselves inside out to try and find the right words to say. This
              is where miscommunication happens. When we put on our
              people-pleasing armour, we&#39;d get caught up in trying to either
              sound nice, or be right, when in fact the real main message that
              mustn&#39;t get lost is: &quot;Despite our differences, I still
              love and care for you, and this relationship still
              matters.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Expressing this doesn&#39;t have to be complicated.&nbsp;Jonathan
              suggests, practice&nbsp;saying: &quot;I want you to feel loved,
              seen, and respected. But I don&#39;t know how to meet that need.
              How can I be a better friend*?&quot; Sister? Brother? Partner?
              Parent? I cringe as I type this, so you may cringe as you read it,
              but what we need to learn is the importance of being direct.
              It&#39;s the more vulnerable route, but it&#39;s the one that

              If you want to meet somewhere on that bridge, both parties need to
              establish that there is a bridge, and that it&#39;s not going
              anywhere. Establish it at the start before it gets heated,
              establish it at the end when&nbsp;the debate finds no common
              ground.&nbsp;At the end of the day and no matter who earns the
              &#39;rightness&#39;, if you ask sincerely how you can love another
              person better, 90% of the time, people will have an answer for
              you.&nbsp;</span
