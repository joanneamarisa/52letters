                  >My grief and joy are roommates. When the light floods into my
                  living room and touches the edge of my sofa each morning, my
                  joy is what pulls me to sit there, soaking the warmth in.<br />
                  <br />
                  Joy opens my window, pours me coffee in the morning, humming
                  to a Chet Baker song our grandfather loves. My grief crawls
                  along the floors, stays&nbsp;in the corner of our dark
                  bedroom, considering blankets her sanctuary from anything she
                  doesn&#39;t feel like facing.<br />
                  <br />
                  I call them roommates because in the home of my heart, they
                  are forced to co-exist. And I used to think I would need to
                  carve out so much space and time for sadness, flush it out of
                  my system,&nbsp;before I can even let the slightest ray of joy
                  to enter.</span

                  >But I&#39;ve learned that both are not mutually exclusive.
                  Both grief and joy are more generous with their space than we
                  ought to believe. Even if my grief is the type to&nbsp;stay in
                  fetal position for 48 hours. Even if there was a day, earlier
                  this year, where I laid in my friend&#39;s bedroom and cried,
                  thinking my world had officially crumbled.&nbsp;<br />
                  <br />
                  Yet in the past month, I have found myself in many bouts of
                  laughter. I have experienced falling in love. I&#39;ve stepped
                  out into nature thanking God with all the words I have left,
                  for everything I witness and hear and feel and touch.<br />
                  <br />
                  I had no idea I would find my way back to wonder, but I know
                  now that it is possible. And I suppose I slip this letter
                  under your doorstep to tell you, too, that it is possible.<br />
                  <br />
                  I am learning what it means to cradle grief as I look towards
                  a future. I am learning what it means to reckon with the
                  heartbreak I&#39;m harbouring, all whilst celebrating the life
                  and people I&#39;ve been graciously given.<br />
                  <br />
                  When given the chance, grief can deepen my joy, rather than
                  hinder it. It grounds me and reminds me to never take anything
                  for granted.<br />
                  <br />
                  And when given the chance, joy gives hope to my grief. In
                  small, minuscule ways, since my grief is almost never ready.
                  But my joy is generous with her light, and is willing to wait
                  as I mourn. And when the two learn to communicate, we find
                  space in the light for my sadness. We find space in the dark
                  for my gratitude.</span

                You&#39;re looking for the explanation, the loophole, the bright
                twist in the dark tale that reverses its course. Anyone would
                be. It&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve had to narrate my own stories
                of injustice about seven thousand times, as if by raging about
                it once more the story will change. But it won&#39;t change.
                Allow your acceptance of that to be a transformative experience.
                You do that by simpling looking it square in the face and then
                moving on. You don&#39;t have to move fast or far. You can go
                just an inch. You can mark your progress breath by
                breath.&quot;<br />
