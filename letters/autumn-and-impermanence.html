              >My Dearest Friend,<br />
              <br />
              Before I delve into this week&#39;s letter, I firstly wanted to
              say thank you. It is timely, that my 3rd letter,&nbsp;<em
                ><a href="out-of-hiding.html">Out of hiding</a>,</em
              >&nbsp;was where this newsletter slowly peeked &quot;out of its
              hiding&quot; &mdash;&nbsp;I had invited a dear friend of mine to
              join our small readership, and when she asked, I allowed her to
              share the&nbsp;letter on her profile. Following that, we reached
              over 20 subscribers (nearing 30 now!), and for that I&#39;m
              humbled and grateful. Thank you for&nbsp;allowing me to occupy a
              tiny space in your inbox.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Last week I also wrote to you, fleetingly, about legacy and what
              it means to be <a href="to-be-outlived.html">outlived</a>. The
              morning after, it reminded me of Disney Pixar&#39;s
              <em>Soul,&nbsp;</em>so&nbsp;I turned on its soundtrack made by
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xnu1aCyx5I&ab_channel=DisneyMusicVEVO"

              >, and at the crack of dawn, listening to his laidback serenade, I
              put on my coat and walked outside.<br />

              >Autumn has descended over Melbourne &mdash; and oh, I bask in its
              glory. Every tree is painted with tints of amber and at 7 AM,
              I&#39;m greeted by a warm, glowing&nbsp;sunrise. It&#39;s not
              actually warm;&nbsp;it&#39;s about&nbsp;8&ordm;C. But
              marvelling&nbsp;at the golden light&nbsp;that lands&nbsp;on
              neighbouring apartments, speckled by shadows of branches and
              birds, warmth came from within.<br />
              <br />
              Autumn reminds me of impermanence, as it always does. A season of
              transience; neither its beauty nor its cold agrees to stay with us
              forever. It arrives before we are ready, and leaves before
              we&#39;d like it to end. Doesn&#39;t that sound familiar?<br />
              <br />
              Seasons like these are time&#39;s way of breaking&nbsp;my ego,
              reminding me I have less power over the universe than I often
              think.&nbsp;When leaves are clinging onto a tree for dear life,
              and eventually fall,&nbsp;they remind me that even my biggest
              worries could someday vanish. My biggest, most recent mistakes,
              I&nbsp;may laugh about when I reach 30. Even the biggest longings
              in my heart &mdash;&nbsp;and as an early-20-something-year-old,
              they are many &mdash;&nbsp;are susceptible to change.&nbsp;Though
              it doesn&#39;t always feel that way, does it? My blunders keep me
              up at night for at least the following 5 business days, while my
              worries circle around me like&nbsp;schools of fish.<br />
              <br />
              But the truth is this: Reckoning with impermanence is a practice
              in reducing&nbsp;our habit of wanting to outsmart what happens to
              us.<br />

              There&#39;s no other word to describe it than humbling. When I
              feel victorious and the world is coated with shimmer, or when I am
              sad and my own shadow has grown twice its size, it is humbling to
              be told,&nbsp;<i
                >Okay, this is how you are feeling&nbsp;<u>now</u></i
              >.<br />
              <br />
              If I&#39;m not careful, I might take offence or lose sight:<br />
              <br />
              When ​I feel triumphant = What do you&nbsp;<i>mean</i>&nbsp;this
              isn&#39;t&nbsp;forever?<br />
              <br />
              When I&#39;m in grief = What do you&nbsp;<i>mean&nbsp;</i>this
              isn&#39;t forever?<br />
              <br />
              It&#39;s a call to recognise feelings as existing, momentary
              things; not the be-all and end-all of really anything. How else
              would we know to never take our joys for granted? And isn&#39;t it
              the solace we need when we&#39;re in&nbsp;a devastating heartache,
              to know it won&#39;t always be as devastating
              as&nbsp;<i>this</i>​?<br />
              <br />
              ​<br />
              <strong>Embrace the now</strong><br />
              <br />
              As someone with the need to control and have things in place
              (wherever&nbsp;<i>place</i>&nbsp;is), being told that adulthood
              comes with unpredictable seasons that don&#39;t last
              forever&nbsp;is... tricky.<i>&nbsp;&quot;</i>I want to plan out my
              life years ahead. What do you mean I&#39;ll&nbsp;<i
                >know when I get there</i
              >?&quot; But that is often the only answer.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Impermanence annoys me, but I succumb. Life&#39;s messy ebb and
              flow leaves me shell-shocked in its wake,&nbsp;but I play
              along.<br />
              <br />
              Especially as an international, where life seems so
              nomadic.&nbsp;Having our existence in&nbsp;a certain place hinge
              on a travel document means we&#39;re always treading on borrowed
              time.&nbsp;This means&nbsp;when things are good, I cling onto them
              indulgently, &quot;sucking the&nbsp;marrow out of life&quot; as
              Thoreau would put it. Taking pictures, going on too many walks
              that cost me time, expressing my love for friends with fervent,
              almost-embarrassing affection...<br />
              <br />
              And you know what? Almost always, even seasons&nbsp;that feel
              overplayed and clich&eacute;, have&nbsp;something to teach
              me.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Let it help you</b><br />
              <br />
              ​Accepting our fleeting highs and lows means accepting the
              inevitability of changed priorities. This helps inform me on a
              couple of things. For example, distancing myself from people who
              would feel shocked or offended by this.<br />
              <br />
              It also helps me avoid comparing my present self to past selves I
              no longer am, nor&nbsp;wish to become.&nbsp;For example
              just&nbsp;because I published more writing 4 years ago,
              doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I have to do the same now. (Because I
              don&#39;t want to do them now!&nbsp;I want to bask in my secret
              postcards.)<br />
              <br />
              In performing my own personal life audit, impermanence helps me to
              ask:&nbsp;Is what I&#39;m doing now in alignment with what I want
              to prioritise this month, this year? Am I surrounding myself with
              the people who are supportive of this?</span

            ><strong>Allow yourself compassion, and change</strong><br />
            <br />
            Contrary to popular belief, I <i>sometimes</i> think it&#39;s okay
            to &quot;settle&quot;. (Okay hear me out). I&#39;m not saying to
            settle for less than you deserve &mdash; my Friend, you deserve good
            things and you better believe it &mdash; but perhaps we often fall
            into the Social Media trap, or External Opinions trap, of where we
            &quot;could be working&quot;, places we could be living, even the
            type of people we could be seeing.<br />
            <br />
            Consider that it&#39;s okay if the good things you want and need,
            right now, aren&#39;t a shiny six-figure job, a two-storey house, or
            a Hallmark movie romance plot. (And if they are, how exciting and
            best of luck to you!) But Friend, you&#39;ll always find me
            celebrating your small wins &mdash;&nbsp;<i
              >I took a walk! I left a toxic work environment! I said No to
              something I don&#39;t want!</i
            >&nbsp;Because they are equally significant.<br />
            <br />
            The run to chase anything under the sun is an all-consuming pursuit.
            Especially the chase towards &quot;what we truly deserve&quot;.
            Whereas honestly? I think you are deserving of what you want and
            need at this point in your life. And if at any point that changes, I
            hope you are in the company of people who are compassionate of
            it.<br style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85)" />
            <br />
            As someone who has (1) turned down a dream job before, and (2)
            worked for 3 years in the wedding department, may I suggest to you
            this truth: That we all settle for what we need, and what we want,
            at a specific given time, and this applies to everything from the
            jobs we have to the person we marry.
            <strong
              >And it does not make those decisions any less valid or
              impactful</strong
            >, because each form the tapestry of this extraordinary ordinary
            life we lead and will look back on.<br />
            <br />
            When we have this mindset that everything is final-and-forever,
            navigating adulthood may feel like stepping into a field of
            landmines. I now see it as it is: Just soil.&nbsp;So I sow, and sow,
            and sow.</span
