            >My Dear Friend,<br />
            <br />
            I made a new friend this week! Well, maybe
            not&nbsp;<em>friend</em>... He was the silver-haired gentleman who
            happened to accept my Uber request one morning. (Sometimes
            you&#39;re just running a&nbsp;<em>little&nbsp;</em>too late, you
            know?)<br />
            <br />
            Mr. Nikola is one of the chatty drivers, you&#39;ll know soon
            enough. He wore a&nbsp;jacket that I first thought was a suit, which
            would&#39;ve given him a dapper chaperone vibe &mdash; but no, it
            was just a very good, vintage camper&nbsp;jacket. An ornament of
            Jesus (or was it Mother Mary?) hangs from his rearview mirror. When
            I entered his car, the radio was on. He begins a conversation.<br />
            <br />
            <em>How are you</em>, he asks.
            <em>Good thank you, how&#39;s your morning?</em>&nbsp;I say.
            <em>Good, good</em>, he replies.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;You can take your mask off, if you&#39;d like,&quot; he said.
            Oh thank you! I said.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;They barely do anything!&quot; he told me. &quot;If you have
            Covid and we&#39;re in this car, there&#39;s not much we can
            do.&quot; I politely laugh.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            <em>Sounds minimally cautious for his age</em>, I thought.
            <em>What is his accent? European?&nbsp;</em>Mr.&nbsp;Nikola drove
            very safely.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;You know, there was a time,&quot; he said, &quot;that you can
            smoke on airplanes! Can you believe it!&quot; He ends every sentence
            with a chuckle. And on&nbsp;<span

              >he talked about airlines, and their no-smoking policy, and how it
              used to be &#39;back in the days&#39;.</span
            ><br />
            <br />
            &quot;Did you watch the Queen&#39;s funeral last night?&quot; he
            asked.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I did!&quot; I said.&nbsp;<em
              >My mother did&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;want to miss it, Sir,</em
            >&nbsp;I wanted to add.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;It&#39;s crazy, I&#39;ve just seen the Queen a week before
            that,&quot; he said, &quot;still standing, smiling and shaking hands
            with people. A week later, she&#39;s gone!&quot; He chuckles
            again.&nbsp;<br />

              >Wait, like see her in person? Or did he mean the TV? Surely on
              the TV. Oh well, too late to ask now.</em
            ><br />
            <br />
            &quot;But she did look quite frail. You know I have a friend... 93
            years old, a more active gentleman than Her Majesty. Every time I
            see him, he wants to buy me coffee. I say&nbsp;<em
              >Let me buy you one&nbsp;</em
            >and he says&nbsp;<em>No Nik, I buy you coffee!&quot;&nbsp;</em>And
            on he chatted &mdash; about his friend&#39;s generosity, the sudden
            news of his passing away.&nbsp;<span
              style="
                font-weight: 400;
                font-style: normal;

              >As we were nearing traffic along Punt Road, the sun peeked
              through, indicating a warm sunny day in Melbourne.<br />
              <br />
              He told me to guess his age, and I was about 9 years off the
              correct answer, and we laughed. &quot;I&#39;m the youngest in my
              club!&quot; he says with a laugh. His sprightly-ness says it all.
              At one point he looked at me from the rearview and said,
              &quot;You&#39;re still young! Have a long way to go!&quot;<br />
              <br />
              And then I think to myself:&nbsp;<em
                >You can learn from him, you know</em
              >. <em>N</em><em>ow or never.</em></span
            ><br />
            <br />
            &quot;So what advice would you give, then?&quot; I finally said,
            &quot;For the young people?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            I let it hang in the air, just like that. He smiled as he was
            thinking.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;<strong>Worry as little as possible</strong>,&quot; he told
            me, with full conviction. &quot;Worrying &mdash; it&#39;s not going
            to fix anything. It&#39;s going to make you sick.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Timely. You probably know by now, dear friends &amp; readers, that
            I&#39;m quite the worrier. In that car, even, I was half in the
            conversation and half worrying about being late. He was right, of
            course &mdash; if worrying had worked in fixing things, our lives
            would&#39;ve been perfect by now, no?<br />
            <br />
            &quot;And second thing is,&quot; he added, &quot;try to do things.
            Go out and do things.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            And I thought, okay, like try all the things and do all the jobs and
            stuff right? He&#39;s going to talk about how he became an Uber
            driver?<br />
            <br />
            But he said, &quot;My friend always says: To be wealthy and
            healthy,&nbsp;<strong>help others as much as possible</strong
            >.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He continued, &quot;A lot of people are selfish, we&#39;re all
            thinking about ourselves and our problems. But try to give, and help
            others, you know? Even in the Bible, it says<em>
              it is more blessed to give, than to receive.</em
            >&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Amen.<br />
            <br />
