              >My Dear Friend,<br />
              <br />
              I&#39;m writing this to you from a hidden gem in the city
              that&#39;s no longer hidden. If you ever find yourself in the
              Melbourne CBD craving for a <i>great&nbsp;</i>cup of matcha (or
              hojicha), Tori&#39;s on Niagara Ln is where you want to go. (Not
              sponsored.) I must say, though, arriving at lunch time is normally
              the best time. And by that I mean, the most possible time to find
              comfortable seating that won&#39;t force you to sit
              shoulder-to-shoulder with 2 strangers in a bench made for two and
              a half people. Anyway. That&#39;s where I am! Having arrived at
              12pm, I&#39;m comfortably nested in a brown armchair that I
              absolutely have overstayed my welcome in.<br />
              <br />
              Earlier this week, I was on a phone call with one of my past
              university lecturers. She mentors me for my
              <a href="https://www.datagardenproject.com/"
                >passion project-slash-side hustle</a
              >
              that I do outside of my work. I was catching her up about my
              experience running an
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqefoQWvqqA/"
                >in-person class</a
              >&nbsp;last month for the first time ever. (Oh, this part is most
              definitely definitely&nbsp;endorsed.)<br />
              <br />
              On top of that, I was asking her for advice on an application
              I&#39;m writing, in which I have to explain about the project in
              great detail. For something I&#39;ve been juggling for the past
              one and a half years, I find it hard nowadays to actually explain
              what the project is about.&nbsp;It&#39;s what happens when
              we&#39;re so deep&nbsp;in the weeds of things. It&#39;s like when
              you have spent such a long time knowing a person, that when
              someone asks you for the first time,&nbsp;<em
                >What are they like?&nbsp;</em
              >You are at a loss for words, thinking,&nbsp;<em
                >Where do I begin?</em
              ><br />
              <br />
              So anyway, here is what my mentor said (paraphrased by memory)
              :<br />
              <br />
              <em
                >I think you can be generous about this project&#39;s
                description. When you speak about the details, don&#39;t assume
                the person on the other end understands what it is you do as a
                whole. And if they&#39;re reading and thinking, What the heck is
                she talking about? They&#39;re not going to continue,
                they&#39;re just&nbsp;gonna put it away.</em
              ><br />
              <br />

                style="

                "
                >I think you need to spell it out. How would you explain it to
                my daughter, who is 10 years old? How would you explain it to my
                daughter&#39;s&nbsp;</em

                  >If you had to yell it across a bar and it&#39;s 3 in the
                  morning and you need to grab their attention, what would that

                ></strong
              ><br />
              <br />
              That last metaphor has stuck to me since, soon becoming my
              favourite way of thinking about how to explain anything: this
              project, or my life as a whole.</span

              <br />
              (Regardless of how she got there in the first place... I mean it
              depends, what bar is it? Is the music great? I hope she gets home
              safely.)<br />
              <br />
              We&#39;re blanketed with facades. We&#39;ve conjured up so many
              fronts about our truest desires, our most unguarded selves, that
              when asked to strip it down to just that one loud, abrupt, simple
              sentence, we have a hard time finding the words.<br />
              <br />
              But it&#39;s night time.&nbsp;And the bar is loud. And we&#39;re
              all here because we all feel a little lost (or perhaps, this is
              where we feel the most found.)<br />
