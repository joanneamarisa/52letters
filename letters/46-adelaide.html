            >My Dear Friend,<br />
            <br />
            About 22 hours ago, I was sitting on a hillside overlooking the
            River Torrens, a stream that stretches across the west to east of
            Adelaide&#39;s CBD. My friend and I had spent the weekend together
            on an agreed-upon &quot;introvert vacation&quot;&mdash;we whisked
            ourselves momentarily away from the busyness of our lives to spend
            the majority of a trip sitting on grass, going on long strolls, and
            getting back early to our hotel room to enjoy the bliss of
            <em>showered-and-in-bed-by-8PM.</em><br />
            <br />
            On the riverside, we sat in silence and people-watched as the sun
            sank lower. To my right, two women sat next to each other, and one
            of them pulled out a ukulele and began to sing. To the further
            right, a man was sitting by his bike, staring at the surroundings
            much like I was. I wondered about his thoughts and his life. What
            brings us to spend a Saturday evening by the riverside?

              Park Named After a Governor; a cathedral called St.
              Peter&#39;s;&nbsp;a Royal Hospital;&nbsp;a Botanic Garden; a

              <br />
              There&#39;s something content and unhurried about Adelaide;
              it&#39;s not a city that strives hard, if at all. The town felt
              spacious, probably due to its oddly serene lack of passersby.

              promised authentic, handmade Korean dumplings&mdash;and delivered
              on that promise. It was run by an&nbsp;elderly couple probably
              well into their sixties; the man was focused on shaping&nbsp;and
              folding one dumpling at a time, while the woman flitted to and fro
              from the kitchen to the counter and then back, never stopping,

              meal, my friend and I chatted about a myriad of things&mdash;such
              as love and family and careers&mdash;enjoying a bowl of udon and a
              plate of steamed pork dumplings, at the table hosted by the

              We then made our way to the State Library and Art Gallery on the
              north side of town.&nbsp;At the library,&nbsp;I walked into a
              dimly lit multi-storey chamber filled with books from floor to
              ceiling. It was so hushed and ancient that if it weren&#39;t for
              the students sitting around with MacBooks open, it would&#39;ve
              felt like stepping into untouched history:&nbsp;mahogany tables,
              chaise lounges, an old wooden clock whose sounds echoed through
              the hall:&nbsp;<em>Click, clock, click, clock...</em><br />
              <br />
              We also stumbled upon a small exhibition recounting the history of
              Australia&#39;s democracy.<em>&nbsp;</em>On a wall, big sign
              letters read,&nbsp;<em
                >My voice matters: Does everyone have equal say in
                Australia?</em
              >&nbsp;The wall beneath it had slots where you can cast your
              &quot;vote&quot;&mdash;the Yes&#39;es were empty, and the No&#39;s
              were filled to the brim.</span

              appreciate the deeper meaning of each artwork that we&#39;d

              breakfasts in hand, we wandered through aisles of fresh fruit,
              seafood, <em>mettwursts</em> which I had to Google the meaning of.
              In spaces like these, I like to&nbsp;daydream about being the

              and some small random trinket she&#39;s running out of like honey
              or apricot jam, before peacefully making her way home. I see them
              all the time in markets like these, wearing their own sunhats or
              effortless, niche pair of hooped earrings. I&nbsp;quietly marvel
              at the life they must live.&nbsp;<br />

              clocks, where a group of families were watching each one in
              awe.&nbsp;They had sections for children&#39;s toys, music boxes,
              mini wooden cutouts of the nativity scene, and a colourful row
              of&nbsp;miniature German houses made of clay, painted in intricate

              I saw a set of harmonicas in a glass case and thought of my
              father, who loved the blues and would play these in some random
              afternoons. When I was a little girl, I remember trying one out,
              and remember how hard I had to blow just to make a measly sound of
              a single chord. I wondered how he did it. It occurred to me that
              Father&#39;s Day was the following day.</span

                ><br />
                <br />
                Which made me think of
                <em style="font-style: normal">deservingness</em>. We live in
                such a way where even in&nbsp;moments of pause, we question
                whether we should be pausing. We begin to believe feeling happy
                or at peace has to do with how much we&#39;ve done or how well
                we&#39;ve done it.<br />
                <br />
                But as I watch the man with the bike or the two ladies humming a
                song with the ukulele or the couple holding hands or the jogger
                running their final lap, it wasn&#39;t deservingness that was
                unfolding in the scene before me, but undefined grace. Either
                one of us&mdash;the little humans in the painting of this
                scenery&mdash;could&#39;ve told a painful lie, had our hearts
                crushed, crushed another&#39;s heart, made a mistake at work
                that felt like it was the end of our lives...<br />
                <br />
                And yet. And yet, and yet. Here we all are, graced by the same
                beautiful afternoon, with the same amount of time and space, and
                it tasted like forgiveness. It tasted like the world outside of
                this little bubble doesn&#39;t really matter. The buildings
                slowly turned into&nbsp;a peachy hue. The sky soon turned to
                violet. My surroundings reminded me of a simple truth: That you
                can hit all the right buttons and the thing you want doesn&#39;t
                come. You can make a series of missteps and still land somewhere
                good. The journey to accept this is both hopeful and difficult,
                because we&#39;re&nbsp;trained to believe that our merit is what
                guarantees us a good life&mdash;and it&#39;s easier to believe
                this, because that means we are in full control of every
                outcome.<br />
                <br />
                But it isn&#39;t, and we aren&#39;t. And thank goodness we
                aren&#39;t, because most of us are quite imperfect and
                fractured, if you think about it. There&#39;s only the life we
                build from&nbsp;the hands we&#39;re dealt. There is&nbsp;only
                sheer luck and grace, and yes unfortunately, occassionally,
                terrible misfortune, and the journey to learn how to accept and
                carry both.<br />
                <br />
                So I sat on that hill and looked at the glimmering&nbsp;water. </span
              >I ponder on the three-quarters of a year that has passed and
              figure there were probably times where I did deserve better, and
              times that I actually took for granted or deserved far less.
              Choosing to release and accept that reality, also released
              <em>me&nbsp;</em>from either ends of palpable hurt and rage, or
              endless guilt. Sometimes, neither the good nor the bad is in our
              doing. It&#39;s okay to let go of that burden.<br />
              <br />
              So I did. I summoned every unfulfilled &quot;what if&quot; or
              every demanding &quot;I should&#39;ve&quot;. I cast it to that
              glimmering water, let it go, and imagined it floating away
              westward.<br />
