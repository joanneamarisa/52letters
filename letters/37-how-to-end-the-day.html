            >My Dear Friend,<br />
            <br />
            Today, we lose. There are days where you come home victorious, where
            you leap into bed thinking, &quot;Ah, today was great!&quot; But
            today is not one of those days.<br />
            <br />
            How did the soldiers come home when the war was over, but lost? How
            must we come home when the world sends us away, defeated? Because
            here we are on a weeknight, marching, like ants, through the tunnels
            back to our little nests, wondering
            <i>why&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<em>how&nbsp;</em>or <em>w</em
            ><em>hat if</em>. We wanted so much to conquer, but alas, the day is
            slipping away from us already.<br />
            <br />
            So go then. Make your way home. <em>But before that</em>, as you
            finally stand up from your desk, sling your bag over your shoulder
            ready to leave, please say goodbye.<br />
            <br />
            Say bye to&nbsp;<em>someone</em>: a janitor, a friend, the
            downstairs concierge. Make sure you say good night to the colleague
            who still has their laptop open &ndash; you might be their reminder
            that it&#39;s time to go home, too. Make sure you smile to
            whoever&#39;s inside the elevator when it dings at your floor. And
            make sure you breathe, on those first few steps outside of the
            building. Take deep breaths if you must. Your best has been enough.
            And if it wasn&#39;t enough today, you&#39;ll have a second chance
            tomorrow.<br />
            <br />
            On your commute &mdash; and you might be stuck in the congested
            streets of Jakarta or standing shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers
            on a train in Melbourne &mdash; look up. No, seriously. This is the
            part of the day that&nbsp;<em>everyone&nbsp;</em>would prefer to
            fast forward. But pay attention. Stay engaged
            to&nbsp;<em>something</em>. A book, a podcast, a playlist, the view
            from the window.&nbsp;<span
              style="

              >We mark the hours spent in transit as wasted or lost time, but it
              doesn&#39;t have to be.<br />
              <br />
              Now hopefully your book or your podcast or your playlist or the
              things you&#39;ve seen from the window have been enough to unlatch
              your mind from work. (Or did I just make you think about work by
              mentioning it again?) But in case it hasn&#39;t, and the worries
              follow you home, leave them, politely, by the foot of your
              doorstep.<br />
              <br />
              I have no authority to bar you, of course, if you decide to come
              home, sit on your couch, open your laptop and work some more. But
              I&#39;ve personally found it healthier to do the alternative: To
              wring it dry and place it by the door, like the soaked umbrella
              that it is, which you know would just drip all over your floors if
              you decided to bring it inside.</span

            Fatigue is a bad place to try and be productive. It&#39;s also a bad
            place to try to be creative, or engaged, or patient, or loving. So
            may I suggest, letting your fatigue be what it is: a signal, that
            your body and mind needs some replenishing. You are allowed to cater
            to that need. You&#39;re not at the office now. You don&#39;t need
            to answer to anybody but yourself.<br />

              done, you deserve to be clean. Douse yourself in water, let it be
              warm (or cold &ndash; you do you), and come out with fresher eyes,
              feeling like you&#39;re in a new skin.</span

            Make yourself dinner. I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s a lasagna or
            leftovers or instant ramen type of night. But my tip? Always have
            some go-to garnishes in the kitchen. Think sesame seeds, bits of
            herbs or chives, &quot;nothing&quot; vegetables like lettuce or
            cabbage, dried seaweed, or even an egg. You&#39;ll be surprised how
            a small touch or a sprinkle can make a meal look, and taste, better,
            whatever that meal is. Now, it&#39;s not just an
            <em>I need to eat so let&#39;s get it over with</em>&nbsp;-
            but&nbsp;<em>I&#39;ve made myself a dinner.</em><br />
            <br />
            Switch off in these hours, if you can. Namely because the world is
            loud as it is &mdash; <em>you heard it out there&nbsp;</em>&mdash;
            and most of the time, you don&#39;t need those voices repeated to
            you by your phone screen. The news will still be there the next
            morning, and your assumptions about them are probably right: someone
            <em>is</em> on a trip, someone <i>did</i>&nbsp;get engaged, and a
            celebrity couple <em>has</em> broken up. That&#39;s it! You&#39;re
            caught up for the day!<br />
            <br />
            Reduce to a minimum anything that doesn&#39;t help you calm down.
            With your dinner, you can turn on your favourite TV show, spend half
            the meal choosing something on Netflix, or let someone know out of
            the blue that you&#39;re thinking of them. (I mean... you
            must&#39;ve been thinking about&nbsp;<em>something?</em>)<br />
            <br />
            You can also read a book, or have a dinner-call with someone you
            love, and tell them about&nbsp;<span

            And finally, when the dishes are in the sink (or are washed and on
            the drying rack,&nbsp;<em>you responsible adult you</em>), it&#39;s
            time for bed. Take that book or that phone call or that Netflix show
            with you, if you&#39;d like. And before you sleep, just
            remember:&nbsp;<span

              Find one thing you&#39;re grateful for that day, and it can be
              something profound like having a job, something simple like your
              breath, or something stupid like your fingernails. And if that was
              too easy, aim for three, or five. You can do even numbers too, of

            And this evening, or on evenings that leave you more crushed than
            others &mdash; we each get our fair share of them &mdash; I hope
            you&#39;ll find crumpled in your pocket, or sitting in your inbox,
            this letter. Not a promise to make it all better, but a salve. A
            reminder that on days when you feel utterly energy- and time-poor,
            by slowing down, paying attention, and not letting go of life&#39;s
            littlest pleasures, we can still make ourselves a little
            richer.</span
